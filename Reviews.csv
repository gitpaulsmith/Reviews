4945,I have always been a fan of trolli candy and when I saw this my mouth immediately dropped. that box lasted me 2 weeks while eating about 6-10 worms a day. really worth the price and you get a nice tub as well for when you're done with the candy. I currently use it to store those keys you find all over your house but you never know what they are for.,5.0,5.0

4950,"What an outstanding combination of flavors!  I must say, the dried fruit was not hard and chewy, as found in other brands I have tried.  The nuts were fresh and tasty - not an ""ewwy"", old-tasting nut in all three cans I received (and have since eaten!).  Highly recommend for those looking for a healthy yet satisfying (and tasty!) snack!",5.0,5.0

4959,My little boy loves these who will be 2 next month!  They are great for trips because they don't have to be refridgerated.  But if we are home I keep them in the fridge for him.  Also they are $1.99 each at the grocery store and with subscribe and save these are only about $1.40 a piece.  Great value!,5.0,5.0
4960,"It's been years since I've enjoyed these and I was dissapointed in not being able to find the ""flavor blasted"" ones promoted back then. This flavor is fine, just not as intense or lasting as I had hoped. My five year old niece adores ""her mints""",5.0,2.0

4968,"A friend of mine first got me hooked on this when he had a sausage and cheese plate at a party. I have always liked ""Honeycup"" brand mustard, but it was a little bit too thick for my tastes. This was a great compromise, and has a really strong kick but isn't burning hot. I can go through a bottle a month, so it got expensive, but buying six like this cut a good percentage off of it. Great deal!",5.0,4.0

A wonderful healthy treat.  Fun. I just love it!",5.0,5.0
4979,"Good price, beats the heck out of the local co-op.  The 'tea' itself  consists of large pieces of hibiscus relative to what you expect as tea, and after you break it up, it only takes a couple to fill the tea ball.  This is like buying 3 pounds of regular tea that has already been flaked.  Great flavor too.  I think my co-op buys this, grinds it, and resells it at 3 times the price.",5.0,4.0
4980,"We first discovered these pouches at our local Target for $1.09.  We had a coupon and thought we'd try them with our 11 month old.

4981,"At first I was very leery about a flavored coffee in whole bean form. My experiences with other brands left a lot to be desired, although the same coffee being flavored AFTER it was ground tasted far better. I fell in love with Maui coffee a few years back while in Hawaii where I also acquired my taste for the macadamia nut. It has been over 10 years since I have enjoyed the true island experience, until now. It is a very rich, smooth, and full flavored coffee; I highly recommend!",5.0,5.0
