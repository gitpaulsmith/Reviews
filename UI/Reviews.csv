161562,B0009F3PGC,3.0,"You know at first I was like WOW these things are salty, but you get used to it after a while. I'm going to have to give you 3 stars cause honestly I donlt know how you can sell this stuff to humans."
79205,B003TNANSO,4.0,These were really good. I didn't really taste any peanut butter which is why it didn't get 5 stars. Also it's a little pricey. But for snack or breakfast they are really quite satisfying. And since it's all natural and gluten free they are great for anybody.
77103,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I'll admit right up front that I am not the biggest fan of or authority on granola (most of it is too sweet for my taste and I am not a sweet-for-breakfast kind of person).  I used to eat granola on yogurt--back when I was trying to train myself to like yogurt--but I rarely eat it anymore, so I don't buy granola anymore either.<br /><br />But THIS granola--Back to Nature's Chocolate Delight--intrigued me because I am a chocoholic.  I couldn't imagine eating it as a breakfast food, but I did find quite a yummy use for it--I sprinkled it on ice cream.  I LOVE the flavors of coffee and chocolate together, so I thought sprinkling it on my coffee ice cream (or frozen yogurt) was worth a try.  It was quite a tasty combination and gave my dessert a great crunch factor, which I love.<br /><br />This granola, unlike most, is NOT oversweet.  When I ordered it, I thought the oaty part would be choclate too, but it isn't (or, if it's intended to be, it's so mild that I can't tell).  When I tried the oaty part of the granola with the chocolate chunks that come in it, it had just the right level of sweetness for me.  When I tried the oaty part by itself, it was surprisingly low in sweetness.  The chocolate chunks are dark chocolate (my favorite) and are surprisingly rich tasting--no cheap chocolate taste here.<br /><br />I don't have any other granola here at home to compare the numbers, but my guess would be that this is a bit healthier than many granolas.  According to the package it is ""made with whole grain rolled oats perfectly sweetened with natural ingredients.""  Reading the ingredient list, those natural ingredients would appear to be evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup.  It is high in calories (220 for a 1/2 cup serving), but I think that is true of any granola.  It has 6g of fat, 2 of which are sat fat, and it has no trans fat.  It has 13g of sugar (which I think is probably lower than most granolas), 4g of fiber and 5g of protein.<br /><br />In terms of eating this granola as a snack by itself, the downside to me is that it is not very chunky.  The majority of my 12-oz. bag was loose oaty bits and chocolate chips...chunks of more than a few oats stuck together were in the minority.  Now, as an ice cream topping, that was a positive thing, but it wouldn't be for snack eating.<br /><br />Will I buy this again when this bag is gone?  Probably not.  But not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't make a great ice cream topping.  As stated, I'm just not that much of a granola person and I really don't need one more snack food laying around the house to tempt me."
17533,B0045Z6K50,5.0,This is my favorite K-cup coffee.  It is very bold and work on any cup size.  We use about 3 K-cups each day so the 80 pack lasts for quite a while.

131347,B004N5C7FE,1.0,My son and daughter received this as a gift form their Grand Dad and were so excited to try it. They hated it my mother and I tried as well and totally agreed with the kids this stuff is nasty!!
157564,B0017T6S0Y,3.0,"tastes ok, but i would get black tea with lemon next time for a little more flavor."
153588,B000FFQ23Y,3.0,"I ordered a case & was dismayed that all the bags contained 70% broken pieces.  I bought these for my gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free son & for small children, broken food is a big deal.  I will pursue a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Once you can get past the broken pieces, they taste good."
250839,B003D3533A,2.0,"I was so excited to find Shade Grown, Fair Trade, Organic, Decaf coffee.  But it's not good.  It just tastes bad, that is the only way to put it.  Coffee should have a certain flavor, even cheap diner coffee tastes like coffee, but this coffee not so much.  It's definitely a light roast, and maybe I put too much in the pot when I made it, but both my husband and I right off the bat said this taste is gross.  I love Paul Newman's Organic coffee, but while I love the message and even the name of Tiny Footprint, I don't think I'll buy it again.  Now what to do with 2 pounds of coffee I can't stand to drink?"
18027,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"This product is very good. I follow the directions exactly and mix it with water.. I havent tried mixing it w/ jelly or honey or anything else, as some others have suggested; the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a lower calorie, lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, so for me, mixing it with 150 calories worth of jelly doesnt make any sense.<br /><br />In any case, this is definitely NOT exactly like regular peanut butter.. the consistency is a little different, but I suppose you could adjust that to your own liking by adding more or less water. Also, you can definitely tell that this is a lower fat product than regular peanut butter; I mean, when you take a tablespoon of regular peanut butter, you can instantly taste and sense the richness due to the fat content, and when you eat PB2, you definitely notice the difference. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just different. Its almost the same as if you are used to eating super premium, high fat ice cream, and then one day you switch to low fat; the low fat may still taste very good, but because you are so used to eating the high fat stuff, you will instantly notice a difference-- however, once you get used to it, it wont bother you.<br /><br />I would say PB2 is the same... its definitely NOT the exact same taste / texture as regular peanut butter, but its still very good. it has a very fresh, ""clean"" taste. in my opinion, its DEFINITELY worth the compromise, considering the huge amount of fat and calories in regular peanut butter, and how much healthier PB2 is in comparison . I have cravings for peanut butter just about every day, but up to now, I have only allowed myself to eat regular peanut butter about once a week, due to the fat and calorie content...  but now, since finding PB2, I allow myself to have it whenever I want it.<br /><br />By the way.. I tried the PB2 Chocolate version-- I ordered a sample from their website-- it was OK.. not fabulous, not bad. to me, if I am going to really ""go for it"" and eat chocolate peanut butter anything, its not going to be a low fat version, because its just not worth it. in other words, if I had a craving for a Reeses peanut butter cup, chocolate PB2 would not satisfy that craving. On the other hand, when I have craving for regular peanut butter-- in a sandwich or right off of a spoon, regular PB2 will satisfy that craving without wrecking my diet. Bottom line: if you arent sure whether or not you will like this product, go to the Bell Plantation website and spend the four bucks and order a sample, and give it a try, then you will know for sure before you commit to buying 4 jars plus shipping. ( and folks, the shipping costs almost as much as the 4 jars, so make sure you like this before you order it! )<br /><br />My final verdict is I am pretty sure I will be replacing regular peanut butter with PB2 for as long as they keep making it, and will probably order it by the case in the future to save on shipping."

78775,B0031UBVX6,4.0,"Definately one of the more expensive baby foods.  Smaller container then any others but my son really likes it.  Got a good deal from Warehouse Deals makes it easier to buy, but still expensive."
240608,B000G7I7DO,2.0,"My first hint that I might not be re-ordering was the caution on the package to ""wash hands with soap and water"" after handling the treats. I've never seen that before. Hmm. The things inside the container looked like some kind of circus side-show of the treat world. They smell strange, and look like butcher-store offal.<br /><br />I understand that dog treats come from the discarded parts of animals, but this product makes it very clear that these are nowhere near what we normally think of as ""food."" There were some bits (unidentifiable) that the dog would not eat, though she would eat most of them. She doesn't seem to be any more enthusiastic about these than any other kind of treat, though.<br /><br />And I don't like carrying a few in my pocket on walks, because some are great big tube-like things and some are tiny stick pieces. And of course then I spend the whole walk wanting to wash my hands. It's just a strange, creepy assortment, and I don't think I'll be getting this product again."
75862,B004MO6NI8,4.0,NO FEAR<br />ENERGY DRINK<br /><br />I have tasted many an energy drink in my day and while some have tasted good at least none have worked for me. For some reason these so drinks do not keep me up or give me that boost or whatever. Still that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy the taste of said products. When it comes to this one it is a bit sweet but overall it tastes pretty good. It is the usual 16 oz can full of energy and taste for most people. I would recommend this to people that are fans of energy drinks.
76679,B0049ULB78,4.0,"Dark Magic is one of my favorite Keurig coffees. I love a dark roast, full bodied coffee - and this one delivers. It's not bitter - it's just rich in flavor.

127957,B001PM0KRU,1.0,"The marshmallows were stale and not well packaged.  They were in a cheap ziplock bag with no dates or labeling.  I was very disappointed, particularly for the amount of money I spent on them."
153419,B001F9QW16,3.0,Its not that these bags are bad - its really more that it takes some time to get used to a compostable bag!!  they aren't as 'strong' as the regular bags you're probably used to (and that goes for me too) so it has taken me some time to get used to the fact these bags don't stand up very long to let's say compost material - but I will say that if you are diligent about getting your composte down to the bin more frequently it is nice to be able to just throw bag and all into the bin!
78389,B001GB7IJI,4.0,"I LOVE Swedish Fish. And the amount is a TUN, and I'm glad, but the fish I received weren't as fresh as I would have expected. And the fish are also the small ones, not the full size fish. That might be why they aren't as fresh as they might have been (the smaller the fish, the sooner it dries out?)... in any case, I find myself a bit disappointed."

17592,B008ZL3XS2,5.0,"This is really good stuff. I was looking for a healthy alternative to white sugar, and read that agave nectar and sucanut are not really that healthy after all. So even though I'd never tried coconut sugar before, I was intrigued about how it tasted.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, as it tastes like a mild brown sugar, and most importantly I don't feel a sugar spike after eating it.<br /><br />I've put it in my organic coffee (yummy!), and cooking with it seems to work just fine (the company says to use it 1 to 1 as a replacement for sugar in recipes).<br /><br />I like that this company uses the profits to support the economy of small farmers in Indonesia.

149347,B001QKGLOM,3.0,"I bought this product and the Golden Valley Natural Organic (Original) in order to compare them.  They're exactly the same price per ounce (the Golden Valley product is organic; the John Wayne organic is more expensive).  They're similar, both fall into the ""soft"" beef jerky category with no artificial ingredients.  However, the John Wayne product is a bit mealy and has a subtle but funny aftertaste.  This outweighs the single shortcoming of the Golden Valley product, which is that it is a bit too sweet."
128796,B0032GREWQ,1.0,"I could just bawl.  This is just one of my favorite products that have been discontinued or ""improved"" in the last couple of years.  I loved Potato Buds for thirty years and I will never buy them again, instead I'll try all the other brands.  I got at least four people (who said they would never eat instant mashed potatos) hooked on Potato Buds, because they were so different and so good.  Now, they're not buds any more.  They're a powdery concoction that has to be contained in a plastic bag, not poured straight from the box.  I thought companies spent millions on consumer research before launching a new product, but somebody definitely screwed up here.  They do not taste better at all and the consistency is not pleasing."
78752,B0031UBVX6,4.0,My daughter currently does not want to eat fruit. I think it has to do with the texture or something.

75838,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"The actual product is flavorful and goes down ""easy""; on a like-for-like basis, I would probably rate this as the best energy drink I have tried (versus the usual suspects ... Monster, etc).  However, I am basing this assumption on my experience of drinking a flat product.  The can was damaged and bloated on top; the shipping box was completely undamaged.  So I wouldn't hesistate recommending trying out the drink from your local convenience store, but I would be wary of online orders based on my experience (who knows, probably is an isolated incident, but could be a packaging issue related to the new product).

127057,B000EIE20M,1.0,"Many people are unnecessarily intimidated when it comes to making curry paste.  I am always disappointed by the people who are impressed with the taste of curry paste manufactured between 6 months and 18 months ago.  Its not hard to find the fresh ingredients and make it fresh.  It takes me less than 15 minutes to make something that is far superior in taste and nutrition to this product.  This product is widely used in Thai restaurants where the cooks don't want to cook, and don't want to invest the time in training workers who change restaurants every 6 months...they just want to hire untrained laborers who can open cans and scoop pre-made mixes out of containers.  It takes a bit of time and practice to make curry paste, but do it a few and you can master the art of working with the spices.  You will never go back to the cheap, low quality substitutes used in most Thai restaurants and sold in Asian grocery store. If you want the real thing, learn to make it or find a restaurant to support that makes their pastes from scratch."

Everything was just as they said.  AS it got closer to the time to get our next shipment, Amazon sent us an e-mail reminding us that if we wanted to change the frequency, we could do that. Since we still had (3) bags left, I decided to bump the order back a few weeks.  I noticed when I got the delivery confirmation, the price had jumped to over $6.00 per bag.  Now I understand food prices do rise and fall on occassion but to jump that much in less than a month, was very fishy. I felt like they had done a bait and switch on the pricing.  Good product if you're willing to spend the  money."
136702,B000CQ01NS,1.0,"I've eaten this product for years due to a wheat allergy.  I loved it so much that I convinced my non-gluten sensitive friends to eat it (and they love it).  For years, I ate it at least once per week.... until this last batch.<br /><br />I'm not sure what is different but this batch of pasta makes me very sick.  I wasn't sure it was the pasta.  The first time I cooked it, I blamed the broccoli I added.  The next time, I must have undercooked the chicken.  The next time, it was the pepper flakes' fault.  Then, the added garlic.  While working through the pack of 12, I eventually developed an aversion to it from getting so sick and started eating it only once per month.<br /><br />The last few times... again, sick.  So, today, I tried it just the pasta and water, nothing else... and sure enough, VERY sick.  I won't get descriptive but I am suddenly very, very sensitive to something in the pasta. I am 100% certain it is the pasta since I become sick within hours of eating it.  I am also positive I have never, not in years of regular consumption, had this type of reaction before this batch.  I just wanted to put it out there in case anyone else has a similar reaction to whatever has changed.<br /><br />I scanned the boxes, just now, to make sure I accidentally didn't get shipped a gluten case and noticed that this is new packaging.  So, maybe they changed the recipe with the colors/art on their box.  Either way, I won't be eating this again and it's a shame b/c it was such a versatile tool in an otherwise limited cross section of gluten free foods that my ""typical"" friends will eat."

127928,B002AN8HSW,1.0,"What follows is a statement of personal opinion, an opinion formed based on published reports from the FDA and other credible sources, and widely available on the Internet.  I am a (recent) former user of Evanger's pet food products, and have no affiliation with them, or with anyone else in the pet food industry.  I deeply regret having ever fed any animal Evanger's products, especially animals I love and care for.  Of course, you must do your own research and draw your own conclusions about these matters.  Evanger's has made an explanation of their side of things in some of these matters, although I personally found their ""reasons""  entirely unconvincing.<br /><br />I would strongly urge you to research this company for yourself.  In particular, read about the FDA's revocation of their permit for failing to process the food properly, and read about the arrest of the owners on charges that they committed millions of dollars worth of utilities fraud by operating their plant for years with the gas and electric meters bypassed.  If, as alleged, they were operating with stolen utility service, what shortcuts would they be willing to take with your pet's health and safety to reduce manufacturing costs?  And in the vein of cutting costs, read about the successful lawsuit by employees for just under half of a million dollars in unpaid overtime wages.<br /><br />I can't post web links here, but my sources include a Chicago Tribune Article dated March 25, 2010, titled ""Lincolnwood couple charged in utility theft scheme"" and two articles on the FDA web site entitled ""FDA Orders Pet Food Maker to Obtain Emergency Operating Permit"" and ""FDA Suspends Temporary Emergency Permit of Pet Food Maker"".  I would also mention the lawsuit against Evanger's by their employees, which Evanger's appears to have lost.  (Source: web site ""Truth About Pet Food"") The Northern District of Illinois Distric Court, Case: 1:09-cv-00227, filed 9/15/2010, Final Approval Order Francisco Barragan and Liberto DeLaRosa, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated persons (Plantiffs) versus Evanger's Dog and Cat Food Co., Inc., Holly N. Sher and Joel Sher (Defendants).  Don't take my word on this, find out for yourself.<br /><br />The picture these events and reports formed in my mind was one of owners who were willing to do anything to make a buck, without regard to the legalities, consequences to their employees, or to their customers.  Maybe you will come to a different conclusion.  Maybe I  am over reacting.  But I want everyone considering their product to learn the facts, read the articles, and make an informed decision.<br /><br />I hope you find this to be useful.  If anyone can point to any error of fact in my review, please let me know, and I will happily correct it, it is my intention to be fair and accurate."

79569,B003TNANSO,4.0,"I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their ""blueberry pieces"" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks"

This is the first time I have ever tried Coca tea and didn't expect much but what I got was nothing at all.  In fact, I've never tried any other coca products (yeah, that one) and thought this might be a starting point before I jump in to the big boy stuff.  Baking soda, bucal, the tea itself?  Nothing.

155619,B000FFLHU2,3.0,"I used a teaspoon of this powder, mixed with my protein powder to make my morning shakes. The taste and smell of this product is not great.  This is why I mix it with chocolate flavored protein powder, cinnamon, soy milk or regular fat free milk. It has a musty, burlap sack tasting kind of scent.  Adding stevia or splenda to my shake helped improved the taste, however, the odor was still there. I noticed after about a week of adding this product to my diet that I felt a little more alert mentally and energetic after drinking it.  Not in a way that caffeine affects me, but in a positive way it helped me get my work done with less brain fog. My skin looked clearer and brighter without makeup on. It had zero affect on my libido. Some users mention its helpful for that, but it did not do so for me. I am not sure I will buy the product again since I know so little about it's benefits. After all, I can just take a super B complex vitamin and feel the same response, no?  But really, the problem with me is the taste.  I plan to finish the bag to see it's longer term affects  and see if they outweigh the bad taste."

Imagine my pleased surprise to find out this tea is both a soothing drinking experience and also...actually works! It has a nice, herby taste and not over-licoricey at all (which I feared, not being a fan.) Really nice with a drop of honey. And then, amazingly enough, my nose and lungs feel open and clear for hours after drinking this tea. One cup, and I ran back to my computer to order a subscription!"

Import Foods also offers a full list of Thai receipes, along with a list of the ingredients needed, and the ability to simply click and order the needed items.

150030,B002XWZH1U,3.0,"I had never seen or heard of this cheese before when I saw it in the cheese section of my local supermarket, so I bought one out of curiosity. It's almost uncanny how caramel-like it is. It looks like an oversized version of a caramel candy you get at a store. It's brown-ish in color (like caramel). It's not a very hard cheese or very soft. It slices very easily. The taste is sweetly reminiscent of caramel. Maybe it would pair well with chocolate.<br /><br />It's so much like caramel that it is very unlike any other cheese I've tasted. That's the reason I only give it three stars - maybe it's technically a cheese, but it doesn't taste like cheese. That said, it's not bad, it's just unexpected."

I gave up and had to cut the top of the bag which makes the little wire reclose hinges useless. So that was annoying.<br /><br />The coffee smells wonderful in the bag & when it starts brewing, it smells even better. So great smell all around.<br /><br />The flavor has hints of nut, but not necessarily Hazlenut. We didn't get any creme brulee, but the flavor is fine.<br /><br />For the price (6$ a bag) it's about the same as a good bag of flavored coffee from our local grocery. Were this there, I would buy it for this price. Comprable to ""Eight O'Clock"" or Dunkin Donuts. Give it a try."

Can get the same deal at the grocery stores when buying an 18 count box for $10 and can even get the Green Mountain brand for that price. Good coffee though and I considered setting up the automatically times shipment to my house every month, however until it drops down to below 50 cents per cup, I won't."
17269,B000GPXRRW,5.0,"Vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate makes for an excellent milk or cream substitute for people who want a cup of coffee, cocoa or even tea when they don't have access to a refrigerator to keep milk or cream on hand. Coffee-mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but it adds so much extra flavor to your beverage that you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!<br /><br />Coffee-mate is easy enough to use--just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want to sweeten with this wonderful vanilla caramel taste.<br /><br />I would use vanilla caramel Coffee-mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.<br /><br />The nutrition label claims it contains no trans-fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans-fats in Coffee-mate are present but very negligible.<br /><br />Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website. They provide you with the website address and a toll free number if you have more questions about vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate.<br /><br />Overall, vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate provides an excellent, sweet tasting substitute for milk, cream and anything else that contains lactose. You may want to use it to sweeten your coffee, tea or cocoa even if you have access to fresh refrigerated milk that you can use. It's THAT good.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!"

I use a large mug and make 2 regular cups of coffee out of one pod, add my sweetner, and am a happy camper. This may weaken the flavor a bit but I need alot of coffee in the morning and this hits the spot. Try it - the price is a great deal better than buying 18 pods for $12 - 17 a pop."
157143,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"I received one 11 oz bag of Melitta coffee from the Vine program. I had requested Hazelnut Creme Brulee and that is what the shipping tag indicated. However, the coffee bag shows it to be Blanc et Noir so that is what I am reviewing. I am a morning coffee drinker and usually have one or two mugs. This blend of light and dark roasts is a fairly average coffee blend. It is somewhat heavier and darker than what I am used to having. I find it to be slightly more bitter than what I prefer. The aroma is somewhat pleasing. For a fairly inexpensive coffee it is a somewhat interesting change from my usual brand which is Gevalia. I would not use this on a regular basis but for a change of pace it offers an acceptable different experience."

It is a pain getting all of the grounds out of the brewing area. I have only used 6 of the k-cups and 4 out of the 6 have been defective. I would not recommend them at all. The coffee itself tasted good with the 2 that I actually had work, but it is not worth the hassle of cleaning up a mess trying to use them. I have requested a refund from amazon and hoping I hear back from them within the next day.<br /><br />-----UPDATE-----<br /><br />Brooklyn Bean Roastery has a great customer service department!! They sent me a replacement box of an assortment of their different k-cups and I am pleased to say I am very happy. I have tried many different ones in the box and they have all worked great and taste good also. There were no decafs in the box, so I can not comment of how they are working now. Although, I have heard the exploding problem has been taken care of. So, I would recommend this company now. Also, Amazon's customer service is great too. They refunded my money for the bad box of decaf."

We were already using the same brand of dog food with great success, so when we found out that there were treats with similar make-up & limited ingredients, we gave them a try & they have worked perfectly as a treat alternative to the normal food kibble in between meals & for training. They are just a little bit on the expensive side, but there are very limited options in treats for dogs with food allergies, & these are the best. Just get enough volume to take advantage of free shipping."

Not sure why they felt they needed to go ""all natural"".  I mean it is candy after all.  And the main ingredient is still sugar.  If you remember and loved Neccos, I urge you to contact them at necco.com and let them know how you feel.  Beet powder and purple cabbage in candy.  Who ever heard of such a thing?"

242568,B002JIO0RU,2.0,"I decided to buy this as a low carb alternative to bread in hopes that I might have a delicious option when I got that craving. Unfortunately this product is pretty disgusting. I decided to make a batch of the garlic toast crisps following the recipe on the Atkins website. Appearance-wise it worked out great, the bread looked like a dense ""soda bread"" style loaf. The problem was that it had a strange aroma of trout/fish and I couldn't get past the smell for it to taste any different. I'm hoping I can find other recipes that might mask/hide this strange quality of the mix, but I'm literally holding my breath."

249543,B001LGGH54,2.0,"I tried this The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, along with the Black Cherry flavor.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />The beverage was sweet, and while not overly sweet, I couldn't help thinking how it reminded me of what cold Robitussin might taste like.  It has a fruit flavor, but I really didn't care for it at all.  Our family drinks a lot of fruit juices and some fruit drinks, so I am OK with strawberry and watermelon fruit flavors, but this one was not that good.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />The Switch is advertised as 100% juice.  It is, but it is juice from concentrate.  I prefer juice squeezed from the fruit or vegetable itself.  In the case of The Switch the concentrate is filtered sparkling water.  I'm fine drinking concentrates and I drink soda too so I'm not being a health fanatic, but be aware if you are expecting actual juice, this product is filtered water used to reconstitute the juice concentrate.  The juices uses are grape, apple, acerola strawberry, and watermelon.  If you aren't familiar with acerola, it is a cherry like fruit, but with three lobes.  Acerola is high in Vitamin C.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />One 8.3 ounce can of The Switch Watermelon Strawberry contains:<br />* 140 calories<br />* 15 mg sodium<br />*36 g carbs (35 g sugar)<br /><br />So keep in mind while it has no added sugar it still has the sugar content from its ingredients.  In fact, It has over 40% more calories than a can of Coke Classic!  It does not have any corn syrup or added sugars though.<br /><br />It also contains 100% of the recommended level of Vitamin C.<br /><br />PRICE:<br />The product costs more than soda, but the ingredients are better.  However, due to the taste, I'd almost rather drink the soda.  Price wise though, this product is comparable to other carbonated juice drinks.<br /><br />Overall, this is drinkable, but it didn't seem that good to me.  It wasn't bad enough to pour down the drain, but after every sip I couldn't help think ""cold Robitussin"""

75798,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I don't drink very many energy drinks. I've taken NODOZ on occasion and have had a few 5-hour energy drinks, and some caffeine candy, but that's about it. Therefore, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tried a can of NO FEAR SUPER ENERGY SUPPLEMENT. The drink tastes surprisingly good. It's not as sweet as a 5-hour energy drink, but NO FEAR doesn't have a bad taste. It tastes like a soda and reminded me slightly of Mountain Dew.<br /><br />I made sure to try my can of NO FEAR late in the afternoon after I had a long day. I felt tired and didn't have much energy and was thinking of taking a nap. The drink gave me a boost, but unlike 5-hour energy, the kick in my energy level didn't happen immediately. It was a gradual boost over about a 45-minute period. The tiredness didn't wear off until several hours later.<br /><br />I'm still not a fan of energy drinks and will continue to limit my consumption of them. However, in the future if I feel I need a pick-me-up, I'll look for a can of NO FEAR instead of just relying upon 5-hour energy boosters. If you're looking for an immediate boost, you'll want to drink something different, but if you're looking for a more gradual pick-me-up, you might want to try NO FEAR."

17668,B002Z04RNY,5.0,These snacks are such a great finger food.  Unlike a lot of other snacks for toddlers we have tried they actually taste good.  My only problem is wanting to eat them before I give them to my daughter.  They are not messy and are the perfect size for little fingers.  The fruit melts very quickly in my daughters mouth and is so easy for her to eat.  All the flavors are excellent but this is our favorite.  Both the blueberries and apples taste fresh and sweet but with no added sweetener.  Great job designing a healthy snack for young children.

I'd asked if any of them had ever eaten them and, if so, what kind of side-effects resulted.  After all the embarrassed smiles and giggles, I didn't have to ask further.

The normally,heart shaped treats that are light, airy, thick, and easy to break,were nothing but,dark,flat,hard to break rocks. So my question is ""What Happened?"" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this."

After being accustomed to hearing constant compliments about my coffee from guests at my home, I'd be embarrassed to serve this nasty stuff.

Also it doesn't mix the same as the other flavors (chicken, fish, plain), maybe because the beef flavor is almost a powder comparatively. Anyways, the dogs slop it up just the same. We add other vitamins and nutrients in with the mix so they get the broad spectrum. We also add a 1/4 cup of regular kibble (Blue Buffalo) just to make it go a little farther and bigger in their stomach so they're aren't whining for food in a couple hours.<br /><br />We also buy from a local shop because their price is spot on, plus it's good to help the local places."

Even the dog was less excited--and she loves (and I mean LOVES) the beef pill pockets. I set out one of each just to see what she'd go for and my vacuum cleaner of a dog went straight for the beef. She'll eat the duck one, but only if that's the only thing available. I had planned on trying the chicken flavor at some point too, but after this I think we'll be sticking with beef."

There was no aftertaste and it did seem to give me more energy to get through the part of the day that just drags on.  I also thought it worked fairly quickly.  I was a bit surprised to discover that each can actually contains 2 servings, at approximately 130 calories each, so it's definitely not a diet-friendly drink. Although I think the drink did provide more of a boost than a diet soda, for me, it's just not worth the extra calories on a regular basis.  That said, I would drink it again and I would recommend the drink to people who are looking for energy drinks or don't mind the calories (and sugar)."

I like the quality--when I compare ingredients on this package to other quick oatmeal products, this brand has better quality ingredients. It is also vitamin fortified, which many other oatmeals are not. It would be even better if it had just a little less sugar--12 gr is kind of a lot, 2-1/2 teaspoons."

It is a heavenly treat!<br /><br />The cookies are bite sized & they are hard.  The minute you open the bag your senses will be delighted by the aroma of chocolate & orange.  They do not taste bland or like ""cardboard"" as some cookies of this type can taste.  Overall they are a decent cookie.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that they are not 100% Organic.  This entire line of Family Recipe cookies is not 100% Organic.  Since I don't have a lot of organic options, I will settle on this brand.  It is nice to have these when I have too much work to do around the farm or it is simply too hot out to have the oven on to make my own cookies - which are the best since home made cookies can't be beat!<br /><br />I also tried their Family Recipe Ginger Snaps & they were very tasty as well with little bits of chewy ginger in them.  The Ginger Snaps are another cookie perfect with hot tea as they too are hard & small. I plan on trying the Chocolate Chocolate Chip next."
77371,B0006VBXCC,4.0,"I picked this to replaced another brand charger that had gotten wet and shorted out when the enclosure it was in developed a leak.  I chose this charger because the manufacture's website says ""...terminals have been moved to the bottom of the unit for added protection against direct rain.""  I understood this to mean that the unit was weather-tight, and could be out in the rain.  Not true.  The instructions with the charger specify mounting it someplace protected from the weather.  Sigh...  I built a box for it to protect it from the rain and it seems to work great.  I only wish someone made a water-tight unit I can just mount outside!"
148616,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"Planter's Big Nut Bars are basically bars of peanuts, sugar, granola, and crispy rice with a layer of peanut butter on the bottom. They're very chewy and pretty good, but I can only handle half a bar at a time.<br /><br />These ""healthy"" snacks are pretty high in calories, and I sometimes found them to be too sweet. I have a serious sweet tooth, but for some reason I couldn't really take all the sugar in these bars. I don't know if it's because Planters wants me to think that this is a healthy alternative to granola bars, and so my mind was rejecting the sugary sweetness, but I definitely could not finish a full bar in one sitting.<br /><br />I'm kind of impartial to the Big Nut Bars; it's definitely something that I won't go out of my way to get at the grocery store, but if it's on sale I would probably pick up a box."

However it tastes strange, king of like sour cocoa with a horrid chemical aftertaste. Ever use hairspray and get a mouthful of the residual fog by accident or get shampoo in your mouth? Imagine that that happened right after you took a swig of rancid cocoa and that's what this stuff tastes like. Sad thing is I bought this and several other WF products after reading a bunch of feel good reviews on the net. Seriously it tastes bad and I'm an avid consumer of low cal foods most people abhor, like Promise. Sheesh I ate it twenty minutes ago and my mouth still tastes like a mini Exon Valdez spilled in my mouth. Blech."

157065,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"I got my package in the mail today & see that it's extra fine grind so I can't use it in my coffee press. No problem as I plugged in a 4 cup coffeepot to make my first brew. What I would up with was a milder form of coffee than the bold & extra bold coffee's which is more like Breakfast Blend from that well known Seattle company. Tried my first sip black & it was ok, thankfully not bitter. Added the usual 2 spoons of suger & it tasted better but it won't be something I'll buy as it's too mild for my tastes even though I used the same amount of coffee as I always do when I made this 4 cup potfull. Couldn't taste any Hazelnut flavoring in the coffee even in that first black sip before I added sugar. All I can say (on my sencond cup as I'm writing this review) is that it's a light coffee with some body to it & that there are no unpleasant aftertaste flavors. It does seem to be weaker in the caffeine department than what I'm used to drinking but some people might like that. All in all I'll finish the bag but as I've said before I'm not going to buy this coffee for myself.<br /><br />I also couldn't get the bag open & had to cut below the seal in order to get at the coffee then I had to pour it into a coffee can I happened to have in my pantry which means I couldn't use the bag that the coffee came in as there was no way to seal the bag up after I had cut it open. So you might want to have an 11.5 oz or larger coffee can with it's lid if you order this coffee from Amazon."
167113,B000LQOEY6,3.0,This is chicklet style gum so two per pack. It stays fresh because each pair is in a plastic baggie. Cute box and so much for so cheap! The texture is very nice and smooth. I was surprised by that. The taste is mastic so that is something to note if you are unaware of what that tastes like. It smells (and tastes) VERY strong. I had to put the gum in several bags because otherwise I could smell it within a few feet of the box.

158018,B001EO5RFE,3.0,"I second the problem mentioned by other reviewers regarding the indigestible whole flax seeds. Two more things I am not thrilled to find out after reading the label (should have done it before placing the order)<br /><br />* The ""organic evaporated cane juice"" is the 2nd most significant ingredient by weight. It is a fancy name but sugar is sugar. There are two more sweeteners down the list.<br /><br />* The 3rd ingredient by weight is ""organic soy oil"". Organic is good, but it is still fat."

148749,B000H7F78Q,3.0,"As a gluten-free chocoholic, I will say that these are the best mass-produced, gluten-free chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have found.  The quality of the chocolate is very good -- a nice, rich, bittersweet flavor.  The rest of the cookie, however, is disappointing.  The cookies are very thick (more than 1/4""), dry, and brittle.  That's rather surprising given their fat content:  a whopping 9g per serving.<br /><br />If you're a baker, you're better off making your own.  But if you're not a baker and you love dark chocolate, these might be right up your alley."
136484,B006Q820X0,1.0,"I'm no lawyer (Or am I?) but I'm pretty sure BBR can't call these ""K-Cups."" This is a suggestion to Ruth at BBR - you need to change what you call these in your responses - you can't say, ""After all, we're filling these K-Cups with BBR Coffee.""<br /><br />I'm not an engineer (Really, I'm not) but I can tell you that making something look like a K-Cup and not engineering it to work like a K-Cup is a recipe for disaster. My initial thoughts were the adhesive wasn't viscous enough, but it's wayyy more than that. The plastic is not thick or rigid enough to be punctured and rooted at the bottom of the K-Cup basket. Instead, the plastic just bends and re-forms in the basket - one of the reasons the coffee grounds are exploding UPWARD. You'll need a thicker, less bendable material.<br /><br />The foil cap isn't durable enough either, though if you replace the plastic with one that's stiffer, the foil may work. The adhesive should be upgraded to a material that can be heated, cooled, heated, cooled and never lose its qualities. You may of tested these in your office, but imagine materials that have to withstand sitting in the back of a UPS truck in Phoenix for 5 days. And after that must work in the pressure of a K-Cup basket just like a K-Cup. And you need to make sure that before sealing, you have a clean surface. Otherwise, no adhesive will work, and the adhesive is the weakest link among these materials. You do realize that steamy coffee grounds exploding can burn your customers, right? You can probably get an engineering student to intern for free to advise you, or hire an engineer. Thus ends my free advice.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~initial review below~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My 36-count box of Fuhgeddaboudit just arrived. I opened it up, wanting to brew one in the Keurig post haste. Unfortunately, after reaching in the box, my hand came out with coffee grounds all over it, and a K-Cup that looked like it never should have passed even the least rigorous quality control standards.<br /><br />C'mon, BBR! I want to LOVE your product! The coffee is delicious! I don't know who is responsible for quality control standards and testing, but these K-Cups are sub-par. Even a newb like me can see that the adhesive you're using is just not viscous enough. Surrounding every round label atop the K-Cup is a nice beard of coffee grounds.<br /><br />I like to think I'm not hard to please. I just want a product that doesn't force me to have to sweep or vacuum after taking it out of the box or removing one from the K-Cup carousel. That's the main reason I got a Keurig......I detest errant coffee grounds!<br /><br />What a disappointment - here I was looking forward to never having to send Green Mountain/Keurig another dime for K-Cups."

The bergamot is very acidic, the flavor was not enjoyable even with added sweet and milk.  The tea was too weak for the flavor of the bergamot to be enjoyed properly.  I love the Twinings tea tins and the ability to create my own cup of tea, but with this tea I have to add other tea to give the cup a good flavor."

After spending about 30 minutes cleaning them out and throwing away the broken ones, I am going to have to give some consideration to whether I order again. At the very least, I think there should be a discount on an order that is leaking!"
78518,B000BQVS0E,4.0,"A couple things you should know -<br />First, I do like this product and will continue to feed it to my baby. She is 18mths and I am transitioning from toddler formula to this drink. So she drinks it from a bottle.<br />It tastes fine, I mix it with water. But it is grainy, it has never fully dissolved, I might try putting it in the blender. And there is always some sludge at the bottom of the bottle, and in the nipple. You also need to use a wide fast flow nipple. And the measuring scoop is too large to mix in the bottle, especially when only using 1 hand :)<br />I have been using it for a few weeks now, sometimes mixing it 50/50 with her formula and sometimes she'll have it straight. She is fine with it but does ask for a sip or two of water after a full bottle of it straight, I guess to wash it down. Her stomach might have taken a week to 'accept' it but nothing major.<br />Overall, good product. My mom has been pushing me to get the baby off dairy... And why not when there is a drink like this out there. And I am so confident in the nutritional value I won't even refill her multi-vit once she is on this fully."

I did drink 1/2 of one mixed with orange juice and it didn't taste bad, but just thinking about that weird smell makes me not want to drink any more of it.<br /><br />I have bought other Vita Coco Coconut Water in the past and loved every one of them.

135961,B005SPQENY,1.0,"I feel bad writing a completely negative review, but there was nothing that I liked about this drink.  The liquid portion was overly sweet (and I have a powerful sweet tooth, so it takes a lot to surpass my limit of acceptable sweetness), but that might have been alright if the drink had been smooth.  The vile part of this beverage, though, is that it has chunks of pulp floating throughout it, so you have to strain it through your teeth.  When I was a teenager, I bought a couple of bottles of a soft drink called Orbitz because it looked cool - it was an overly sweet liquid with tiny gummy spheres floating throughout, and after the cool factor wore off, I never bought another bottle.  This Chantea has almost exactly the same effect on me - from the outside, it looks cool, like an ordinary trendy healthy beverage, but the experience of drinking it is almost nauseating.  I do not recommend it to anyone."

Unfortunately the Reeses PB cups were flattened and appeared to have been exposed to a temperature above room temp. Since I am in the midwest and in the 60-70 temps, guess the storage in the Amazon distribution location may have led to the softening/melting. The delivery was quick and packaging was great. So my only conclusion is the candy left the fulfillment center without proper temperature controls when stored. And must likely rough handling before I even ordered it. Spoke with Mateo at CS. He is going to try to make sure that they follow the temp guidelines. If you have a similar Hershey product, please return it. I probably should have.

Just put a cup of rice in a bowl, add enough water to go 10% above the rice line, cover with a dish, stick in microwave for 3 minutes, remove & mix, microwave again for 3 minutes, remove & mix, continue to microwave for 3 minutes until the rice becomes translucent.

And ground yellow corn is essentially just another non-nutritious filler.<br /><br />- Expensive. Obviously Purina is trying to market this dog food as a higher-end healthy product, but since it's actually not, and priced about the same as much healthier alternatives, it is incredibly expensive for something so cheap. I would recommend this product instead: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6"">Nature's Variety Prairie Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal & Brown Rice Medley, 30-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />- Some pieces too big for small dogs.<br /><br />OVERALL: Not recommended. Your dog will eat it up, but won't be healthier because of it. For the same price, get something that actually is healthy and not just marketed that way."
78498,B00497ZQTU,4.0,These sour apple chips are very sour.  I can only eat them one chip at a time.  Just as well since they taste great and lets me savor the flavor.  They are definitely a bit different from the other Seneca Apple Chips flavors which are much sweeter.

125569,B000P3T4HW,1.0,"I was so excited to hear of this product, being a big fan of peanut butter. I was sorely disappointed. It has a grainy texture and slimy taste in the mouth. Since it wouldn't work on sandwiches, I figured I'd use it in peanut butter cookies, but no. The dough was sticky and unmanageable; the cookies spread out into a chewy mess. Cannot recommend it."
136994,B002AQP5FW,1.0,"I was excited to try one of these before purchasing in bulk.  I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this product.  I have used Bob's Red Mill in the past.  I will stick to that.  Sorry, I am not being ""negative"", just being honest with my opinion."
253380,B004JRMG98,2.0,"It's a lot like a jalapeno-flavored mayo.  I would rate the heat level as a 2.5 on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being the hottest.  The flavor of this sauce is not bad, but there's nothing special about it either.  Of all the competing sauces available, this Taco Bell sauce would be rank similar to processed cheese slices--it has it's place but is probably not a key component in a special meal."
236345,B000CONM8Q,2.0,"I actually love Pirate's Booty snacks so I was over eager and purchased 2 huge cases of these.  Yikes, these are going to hard to get rid of.  A previous reviewer states that they are like fish food and I second that notion.  I would definitely recommend steering clear of these, and choosing one of the much better flavors like cheese.  I don't know exactly how to describe these, but imagine a stale sock soaked in broccoli juice and you're on the right track.  My typically non-discriminating 14 month old turns his nose up at these.  These taste like something super healthy, and though they aren't bad for you, they are not healthy enough to warrant choking them down.  They are worth a try as a toddler snack, but I'd order cautiously or you will have lots of fish food tasting snacks that you will be trying to give away to any unsuspecting victim that will take them off of your hands."

124888,B005BHIESC,1.0,"I bought this on sale and thought it was a great deal.  How can one go wrong with coconut juice?  Apparently Vita can with their tropical version.  I haven't tried their plain coconut juice, so I don't know what that's like, but I can assure you that the tropical one is very difficult to drink.<br /><br />One would think it's very tasty due to the mixture of fruits, but it's not.  Imagine drinking coconut juice and adding a bit of sour and a bit of sweet -- that's what this is.  Some people may like it, but it's just not good in my opinion.  To me, it seems like Vita had a bunch of excess juice from other products and decided to just mix it all together with a splash of coconut.<br /><br />It's not worth the regular price, and not even worth the sale price (I purchased these for under ten dollars for the pack of 12)."
82234,B001NGASS4,4.0,"Just to be clear- this is not authentic French onion soup.<br /><br />I've made the real thing- versions that require a few days and a lot of beef to make the stock, and those are delightful if one has the time and money and dedication.<br /><br />This kit is for when one does NOT have that time, money, and dedication. It also has some rather odd- as French onion soups go- but flavorful additions such as carrots and tiny lentils.<br /><br />However, when made up it is easy and very good; it does not taste like it was made from a mix; it does have a lot of onion flavor- rather the point of FOS; and the added ingredient list is not excessive (to my recollection, it calls for a sauteed sweet onion in butter, 6 cups low-sodium beef broth, apple juice, and Worcestershire sauce).<br /><br />I served it with gruyere toasts: pieces of italian bread, toasted, with gruyere melted onto them, as a nod to the classic ""croutons"",and my family liked it very much.<br /><br />Sauteed browned mushrooms would be an excellent addition, which I will do if I make this again!"

I know that is not the best explanation, but it was hard to pin down. Everything was stuck to the wrapper so maybe it gives off an odor when heated. Just a guess. In regards to the natural ingredients, I appreciated that they made sure to use as few fillers as possible. I would try another flavor anytime."
77641,B001LG940E,4.0,"This carbonated fruit juice drink is a tasty alternative to soda, with the added bonus of containing 100% of your daily vitamin C.  It's not low-calorie (most juice drinks aren't) but at least there's some nourishment to it, not just sugar and carbonated water.  It's naturally caffeine-free, too.  The black cherry flavor is lightly fruity but not overpowering or ""medicine-y"" like some other black-cherry soft drinks.  I'd drink it again, and I'm inclined to try their other flavors as well."

253322,B004JRMG98,2.0,"Yeah, Taco Bell isn't exactly associated with healthy living. While it may say Taco Bell on the label the sauces are actually manufactured by Kraft Foods. They pay Taco Bell to slap their name on the label and voila you get a more recognizable brand. The sauce is not my favorite of the three I sampled. It's just really a processed taste almost like cheese sauce. The other ones actually have a more bold flavor but this one not so much."
77790,B001LG940E,4.0,"The Swich Black Cherry is a 100% juice drink with a balanced cherry flavor.

However, since most would buy it for true coffee fans, I have to give it only 2 out of the 5 stars.<br /><br />The coffee really tastes like chocolate, not chocolate-flavored coffee, and even as coffee is a little weak. It comes as a bag of ground coffee, not individual packs, not instant, we brewed a full pot.<br /><br />The serious coffee drinkers said they would prefer a more robust-flavored coffee, which only has a hint of the flavoring. But, everyone agreed it was drinkable and plan on finishing all of it!<br />Tracy Foote, Author: The Kid's ROTH IRA Handbook"

Its sweeting strength is a little weaker than I anticipated, but it will still last maybe 3 months because I combine it with the spoonable Stevita.  I iniatially used it without the spoonable stevita, but didn't like the taste.  Combining it is perfect.

240175,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"For some reason my dogs just didn't like this food.  I began by mixing it with their regular food (similar ingredients but much cheaper), and they actually picked the pieces of it out.  I have a Golden Retriever, A Golden Retriever/Lab mix, and a Chihuahua/Whippet puppy.  The only one that actually liked the food was the puppy, but she still eats puppy chow, so I didn't give her a lot.<br /><br />The only way I could get my dogs to eat this food was to add something to it, like a little bit of canned food, which they don't normally get.  I found it unusual because they usually aren't picky eaters, but they just didn't like this food.  Since I had a large bag, I had to add something to it every night in order to get through the bag.  They would still leave some food in their bowls, which the chihuahua would eat.<br /><br />I see by the other reviews that most of the dogs loved the food, but for some reason mine were the exception."

I'm sure the texture issue has to do with the dried mango.  I tried it with both almond milk and coconut milk, adding 1/2 frozen banana.  It turned out way too sweet as I didn't realize it already has sweetener in it.  Without the banana, it wasn't any better.  I still have quite a bit left...I will try it with OJ as someone else commented on doing.  Hope that improves the taste!"

I was actually eying this product for awhile before ordering it because I personally love potatoes.  No salt?  Great.  All organic?  Wonderful!  $2 a can?  Kinda pricy.  But wanted a healthy soup to add to my brown rice.<br /><br />After putting it in the microwave for 3 minutes, which is what I always do with soups, it came out looking like mush and tasted like it also. I have 11 more cans to go through though so bought some hot sauce, going to try chili powder and pepper.  As for the looks, I don't mind so much if it fills me up and healthy for me.<br /><br />The lack of flavor and having to find things to add to it makes it not worth the cost for me.  The killer is, out of the 12 pack, a single can wasn't dented.  The packaging was fine so I doubt they were damaged when shipped.  I also ordered the chicken noodle soup from the same brand, but I haven't tried that yet.  Same problem with the denting.<br /><br />Would I recommend?  Nope.  I'll never order again unless the price drops to $1-$1.50 a can.  Even then, anticipate being creative to make it work for you.  I have 11 more cans to go through.

It still has way to much salt but at least the flavor is decent.  Again, the gravy is substantial and helps mask the blandness of the turkey and stuffing. However, I will NOT be buying this product again.  At almost 1,500 mg of salt, ~ 30 to 45 grams of carbohydrates, ~3 to 20 grams of sugar and ~10 to 15% of saturated fat per serving this would not be considered a good diet for anyone.  They do have 13 to 24 grams of protein in the form of ""hydrogenated"" corn, soy, and wheat protein.  They also have MSG hidden in the ingredients list as 'autolyzed yeast extract'.  I find it hard to believe that this big company can not make a decent product that is not loaded with CRAP!  I DO NOT recommend this product at all!!!"

Whenever we decide to give her a treat we ask her if she wants a ""snackee"" & she gets very excited.  She'll run in circle & stand on her hind legs.  When we gave her this for a ""snackee"" she just looked at it, smelled it & then looked to us like we were joking her.  We left it there & she looked at it again & smelled it & then chose to walk away from it.  This dog turns down nothing except for lettuce.  After it sat there for about 30 mins I put it in her dog dish & about 6 hours later she decided to get it out & contemplate eating it for about 10 more minutes before she decided to finally try it.  She did finally eat all of it but we know she wasn't big on it because the next couple times we gave her one it was the same routine, it sat for hours before being eaten.<br /><br />Her opinion is that she's not big on them & wouldn't recommend them but if given one she'll eventually eat it to make it go away."

Not wanting to waste my purchase, I now cut open each K-cup and put the coffee into my My K-Cup Reusuable Coffee Filter that goes with my Keurig. The coffee itself is pretty good, but I could have bought a bag of gourmet coffee for a lot less money if I am going to have to use my reusuable filter anyway."
239255,B005NYXE8S,2.0,"By the time I was done reading so many colorful reviews for this product, I purchased it out of curiosity. I like to be as honest as I can in my review of a product. I found that much of what reviewers had to say was indeed true. This is a very steep price to pay for the amount and selection of candy included. I did my best to consider every aspect, but still it came up lacking. Any time we can get a variety to choose from in one package, it is fun. Like a grab bag type of thing. But if the majority of the things in the grab bag are cheap, it takes away from it.<br />  It makes me think about shopping for music c.d.'s with a variety of different artist on it. Yes, the idea is nice, but if the majority of the songs don't sound good, I would much rather skip it!!!"

The first was crystalized ginger, which would have been processed in a whole different manner, and presumably on different equipment. The warning is for ""equipment"" and not ""facilities.""<br /><br />I'm starting to think that it's a catch-all liability disclaimer put on all products, given that it names every allergen that has to be labeled -- which is not very helpful to those of us who rely on allergen statements."

But, in comparison to having no eggs vs. expensive eggs, I definitely choose these expensive eggs.  Worth it.<br /><br />Update:  Down graded from 5 to 2 stars.  Ordered more eggs on 5 Sep, paid extra for expedited shipping, the eggs still haven't arrived.  Contacted the seller, who refunded the extra charges but gave no explanation except to say the eggs are shipped from the farm on Monday or Tuesday each week.  This doesn't explain why the eggs weren't shipped until 17 Sep.  Am not happy with expensive eggs that are not here."

253460,B004JRMG98,2.0,"Now, I love spicy food.  I know from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R6HC2A"">Tabasco</a> (I've been to the factory), <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZHPFI"">Crystal</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004JQW54"">Texas Pete</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO"">Sriracha</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFRJSA"">Cholula</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MGEU0W"">sambal</a>, Indian green curry, Jamaican jerk, and all manner of Asian and Southeast Asian hot.  So, this item caught my eye.<br /><br />It's not entirely clear what Taco Bell is going for with this product.  It's a gastronomic oxymoron: a sauce that's kinda spreadable, and a spread you can use as a sauce, and it's creamy and smooth like a friendly salad dressing, yet somehow also spicy and bold.  None of these worked for this consumer.  Decide on one product, Taco Bell, and roll with that.<br /><br />That being said, I think I get the marketing angle.  There are Americans who like the hint of spice, and who love to tell their friends and Facebook that they just loooooove spicy food so totally much, yo.  But what they mean by spicy is the toned-down peppered-ketchup buffalo wings at Applebee's, or maybe even that ""bold and spicy"" steak sauce they had a tiny taste of once, the one with the cracked pepper in it.  ""Bold n' spicy"" has marketing cachet these days, and it looks to me like this product is angling to get in on it.  But, this consumer is not impressed, because this sauce is not bold, it's lame.  ""Creamy"" is for dessert toppings and coffee add-ins, not some faux-TexMex factory liquid.  The attempt to conflate the two together is a failure.<br /><br />It's neither sauce nor spread.  The copy says it's the ""perfect finishing touch for your tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps!""  Well, I put truly spicy salsa verde on my tacos, really chunky sauce that has flecks of browned chili skin from the roasting, and has bite and sting...you know, truly spicy, to go with the garlic, onions, black olives, all of the other bold--most certainly non creamy--tastes and textures in Mexican food.  Honestly, even an authentic guacamole isn't ""creamy.""  I can't really imagine what kind of ""Mexican salad"" this would go into.  I've made a taco salad or two in my day, and chunky salsa is the only dressing for that; putting this stuff on it would ruin it.  I did, however, make an effort to use this sauce in some sandwich wraps.  Sadly, it's too, uh, saucy, to use as a spread, too runny, with the sauce running out the bottom of the wrap.  If it's going to be a mayo-like (the ingredients list egg yolks, whey, soybean oil and buttermilk) product, it's got to be more firm and spreadable, not a thin sauce.<br /><br />Let's be clear: this product did not taste bad.  I got a slight twinge of jalapeno in there, but nothing even close to spicy, not even ""bold.""  The taste has a definite mayo/ranch twinge and feel to it.  There are some dark green flecks of some sort in the sauce yielding the slightest hint at texture; it's totally unclear what they are, maybe the bell peppers, parsley or spinach listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />I also don't understand the size of the product, only 8 ounces.  If this is a multi-use product, for all kinds of different dishes and apparently intended as another tableside condiment like ketchup and ranch dressing, why the small package?  It needs to come in at at least 12 ounces to be taken seriously.  I made four sandwich wraps and put some of this sauce on some sausage at dinner, and this package was done.  If Taco Bell wants this to get used, they need to upsize the package.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's sauce, that much is evident, but I'm at a loss as to what I'd put this in while cooking, or what I'd pour it over upon serving.  It's creamy, yeah, but one usually doesn't associate bold, spicy food with creaminess.  Taco Bell is trying to cover all bases with this product, and for me it doesn't work."

But today I was feeling a bit tired, so I thought I'd go ahead and try it. There were no warnings on the package, so I figured it was probably ok.<br /><br />I sound like I'm building up to some kind of terrible reaction, but nothing happened. There was no effect at all, good or bad, because I just couldn't drink the stuff. I tried, but it was so nasty. It's very sweet on the surface, like artificial sweetner. This didn't bother me so much, though. What bothered me was the bitter, flat under-taste it had. It tasted like the lemon-lime laxative doctors force you to chug when they want to clean you out. Really awful. And it didn't go well with the artificial sweetner. It was bad enough to make me shudder.<br /><br />I'm sorry I can't write about how beneficial I found this drink mix.

Not too big a deal because it costs money in gas to get there so the price is on par and maybe better.<br /><br />The organic coffees just taste better and Newman's products are well made -- as if they really care about taste.

And I really tend to like flavored coffees. I tried this product twice and it really left me feeling right down the middle. I didn't love it or hate it, but it was okay. The first pot was made after Sunday dinner and drank black and the second one was made yesterday morning where I drank it on the front porch while I read and bird watched while the rain fell gently and I had it with cream and sugar. These are two nearly ideal set-ups to evoke good coffee feelings, and I just wasn't impressed. There was mild gratitude for the caffeine during the morning session.<br /><br />Yes, it tasted like hazel nut, and I guess Creme Brulee, and I like both of these flavors and the coffee was smooth, but the end result wasn't as pleasing as it should be, as I anticipated it being, as the random cup of coffee at one of the local restaurants is on any given Sunday.<br /><br />Later on in the day, my husband asked me about it since he was the won I conned into brewing the second pot.

Nothing tasted as good.<br /><br />But either my tastes have changed or the coffee is just not as good because this coffee had no depth.  I made it with less water than the smallest Keurig option to give it a fair chance.  I smelled it before I drank it and got no strong whiff of fresh brewed coffee.  I drank it black with no rush of memory of the original brew from forty years ago. I added a squirt of cream and it only got blander.  I drank it with a Spanish omelet (thus the iHop connection) and it served only to wash the food down.<br /><br />Now that I've finished this cup, I'll give the rest of the box to my brother and brew a fantastic cup of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K"">Barista Prima Coffeehouse, Italian Roast, 24- Count K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers</a>."

I placed an order for several cans because they are not available in the area where I recently moved. Upon opening the first can I was thoroughly disappointed to find the contents to be broken into little pieces. Not one of the cans had any piece more than 1 1/2 inch long. Most of the pieces were under 1 inch. Unless you intend to use them as a crumb topping for ice cream or something similar, don't order them thru Amazon."

Two years ago she was diagnosed as anorexic; while recuperating (after being hospitalized and tube fed for several weeks), I researched feeding enhancements for cats, and fish flakes was highly recommended. I was dubious but decided to purchase one jar from local pet store. At first, I would sprinkle a little on top of her baby food treat and it worked. Now I buy in bulk and have to hide the container. She is happy and healthy and loves ""her fish flakes.""  Tried different brands, she likes them all. However, this brand/site is the LEAST EXPENSIVE. Sophya gives them Five-Stars."
245824,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"Yes, the description says that some of flavors may be substituted without warning due to product availability. That being said, you are still led to believe that you'll be getting a wild assortment of 34 different flavors. Instead, I got 6 butter toffees (which I already knew I don't like), 5 pumpkin spice (which are just ok from past experience), and a bunch of other 5s and 4s. Only got maybe 2-3 unique flavors in the entire box. Otherwise, it was all repeats. The posting is totally misleading, so don't order from them if you actually think you're going to get a lot of different flavors and roasts to try.

I wouldn't put much faith in their effectiveness as teeth cleaners though.<br /><br />As a ""dog mom"", I was not impressed with the ingredients.  These biscuits had far too many ingredients that just didn't measure up as ""health encouraging"" to inspire much faith on my part.

164913,B003IRIEHI,3.0,"UPDATE (12/3/2011): The food in the last case that I bought was substantially different from previous cases. The pieces were much thicker and of a tougher consistency. Because of this, my cat was only licking up the gravy, picking at a few pieces, and leaving the rest in the dish. I don't know if it was more difficult to eat or less palatable, but I ended up having to donate the rest of the cans to an animal shelter. Because of the wide variation in preparation, I had to stop buying this food for Moxie.<br /><br />ORIGINAL: My cat goes crazy for this wet food. When he was younger (about 7 months ago), I tried to give him the same brand dry food supplemented with this wet food, but we had vomit problems with the wet food. When I re-introduced this wet food about a month ago because I was concerned about only giving him dry food, it was like night and day. He gobbles it all up every day, and there have been no vomit issues whatsoever. He knows that morning time is when he gets his morsels, and he sits in the middle of the kitchen and cries until I give it to him.<br /><br />I like that this food comes in larger chunks rather than tiny shredded pieces. It reduces the mess the cat makes in and around his bowl. I also like that there are few artificial ingredients, just like the same version dry food. The cans are only 3 ounces each, which is small if this were the only food you're feeding your cat, but for our purposes of half a can supplement a day, it's perfect. I just feed half a can and put the other half in the fridge for the next day."

I should have read other reviews before I purchased this since I can't even return it. It just has a really horrible lacking taste about it that is not satisfying like other chai tea brands with combination of several spices as it should be made with. I have gotten the Davidson's English breakfast and children's tea before and love them, but the classic chai is a major disappointment. Even Stash brand from Jewel tastes better than this. It just smells wrong to begin with. It's more like clove cigarettes."

135930,B005SPQENY,1.0,"This is the newest aloe-based tea entry from Chantea. It's a ""health drink"" that touts its green tea component prominently on its label, which wisely is a wraparound given that its inclusion of tons of little pulpy bits is going to put many drinkers off. Except for orange juice and the like, most people don't have a lot of experience with non-smooth clear drinks--this looks and feels in the mouth a lot more like bubble tea or mega-pulpy orange juice.<br /><br />The taste: oddly medicinal, with the passionfruit carrying the tone of the drink and a strange astringent aftertaste that lingers way too long on the tongue. I didn't taste much green tea in this, but that's not a huge shock given that the first two ingredients on the label are water and sugar. The main flavors are ""sweet"" and ""strange fruity sensation."" Indeed, this tiny little 11.5oz container is apparently considered 1.5 servings (another thing that will put off American drinkers at least, who are accustomed to consuming a bottled drink at one go and certainly won't pour out only 2/3 of the drink and save the rest for later), which makes it possible for the manufacturer to put its carb count at 20g rather than the 30g it probably should get--which makes it pretty much an uncarbonated soda. I'm very put off by the fast-and-loose game played with the nutritional label.<br /><br />The texture was also unpalatable. I'm no stranger to pulpy bits in my drinks, but these were as numerous as they were undefinable. Were they aloe bits (doubtful but possible, but they looked precisely like an orange's pulp)? Were they passionfruit (way more likely but passionfruit pulp is not in the ingredient list)? The ingredient list gave no indication whatsoever what I was tasting.<br /><br />I think this drink would appeal way more to consumers who are used to pulpy drinks like bubble tea and who don't mind drinking that much sugar water--and who are way way into passionfruit. For me, as much as I'd looked forward to trying it, I couldn't finish the bottle."

154846,B002O039DO,3.0,"Mmmm, it's the time of year when I remember how yummy pumpkin tastes.  So when I saw this Pumpkin Bread kit on sale I decided to give it a shot.  The recipe was super easy.  Add a few eggs, oil, and water to the canned pumpkin and then add their prepackaged dry ingredients.  I baked mine in a bundt pan (baking directions are on the package.)  The mixture provided too much batter for the bundt pan.  And even taking some out made for an overflowed baked product.  The final product tasted fine.  The texture was a bit chewier than expected.  And the spice level was a little muted.  I'm sure you could do better if you made it from scratch.  But do you really want to do that?<br /><br />The box shows you can also make muffins, so I'll try that next time.  I bet you can spruce these up with a little spice, and maybe jazz up the icing with some cream cheese."

77616,B001LG940E,4.0,"I really liked the light carbonation and the well balanced cherry flavor.  The 8.3 ounce size is easy to stuff into a bag or lunch box.  The short ingredient list is a healthy improvement over soda pop.  One consideration is that, even though there is no sugar added and no corn syrup added, there is still 33g of sugar in one serving.  However, if you want real juice, the carbs will be unavoidable.  The only down side is the price."
124863,B005BHIESC,1.0,"When I bought this, there were no ingredients to be found. Not here. Not on the maker's lame web site.  From what I could tell by the photo, it looks like coconut water, pineapple, orange and watermelon... and that sounded really good.<br /><br />I actually complained to the company that there was no information, and they added the content to this page.  As you will see, it now says ""coconut water, pink guava, oranges, red dragon fruit, and pineapple""... and gross.<br /><br />I don't know where the pink guava and whatever the frig red dragon fruit is on the photo, but apparently what I thought was a watermelon is one of the two.  I have also tasted the plain coconut water, and the only good thing about that is that it is a base to add with something else.  The only combination that works and is tolerable to drink is the coconut and pineapple combo.  And even after a couple of those, you don't really enjoy it.  But this tropical fruit case is still in my fridge.  I tried 4 different times, and each time I have had to dump it.<br /><br />... and Rihanna is certainly not a selling plus for me.

For the past several months whenever I open a new bag, half the contents have gone bad.  They are covered with what looks like fungus or something and we end up throwing it all out(not knowing what it is).  It's too bad  because early Okay bags tasted fine.  Perhaps it's because they are unsulfured, I don't know.  They have been stored just like other dried fruits we buy, in a Pantry.

127861,B003QSA9SQ,1.0,"I have become obsessed with trying every fig jam and preserves and chutneys I see available.  They are truly wonderful with goat and sheeps milk cheeses.  There are many brands which are simply wonderful - unfortunately this one is not!<br /><br />The flavor is NOT rich and figgy - it tastes diluted and flat.  The consistency has too much gelatin in it so it is NOT smooth and creamy as it should be.<br /><br />I keep my fig preserves in the refrigerator for AGES - and they never, ever go bad - I had one in there for over two years.  This brand however, actually went MOLDY after a couple of months!!  Good riddens to the most disgusting fig jam I've ever had!<br /><br />Now for some recommendations for delicious brands:  Bonne Maman Fig Preserves (France) is widely available and very nice - creamy with a nice fig taste.  The Adriatic Fig Spread (Croatia) is very widely available - it has a rather bright, fruity taste, a bit more tangy - but also nice. L'Epicurien (France) makes a bunch of fig products - some which I haven't tried yet - but the one I have tried is their Fig and Walnuts Confit.  It is pricey for the size (only 4.4 oz) but it DIVINE - really indescribable - very rich and intense - somewhat sweeter than regular fig preserves - worth trying at least once.<br /><br />And finally is the Vergers de Gascogne Fig Jam (France) imported in US exclusively by Williams Sonoma - and as far as I know - only available in their stores - not on their website.  This one is amazing wonderful - a classic - call them and find out how to order.<br /><br />I have another 6 brands in my pantry ready to taste - but too soon to recommend.  But don't waste your money on this one - that is for sure..."

130021,B005TY26JU,1.0,"We ordered these for my granddaughter, who is part of a family of celiac and gluten allergic people, and who is showing signs of some food allergies.  Although they are advertised as gluten free, the cookies contain barley flour which is NOT gluten free.  We were attracted to these cookies as they were advertised as gluten and dairy free, as well as organic and non GMO. The box itself is labeled as organic and non GMO but does not mention any of the food allergies mentioned on Amazon.  We are very disappointed about this and had actually opened the box and let her have one before we realized the problem.  She did enjoy the cookie, so apparently it tasted good to her.  If it were not for the misinformation and potentially very dangerous error about being gluten and allergen free on the Amazon page, they would be great for other consumers.  However, it's hard to understand how this potentially dangerous of a mistake could be made.  These are not cookies we feel comfortable using, and my daughter is so gluten sensitive that she can't actually touch the cookies to feed them to her daughter even if the baby wasn't showing signs of allergy."
133236,B0090X8IPM,1.0,"I'm usually a big fan of Starbucks' bagged coffees and of flavored coffees in general, but this one just has an odd taste and aftertaste to it.  It doesn't even really taste like vanilla to me -- just like some kind of flavored hot beverage.  I even tried brewing this with different strengths to see if that made any difference, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.  I'd stay away from this one.  It really just doesn't taste good."
149192,B000J423MK,3.0,I have looked everywhere for powdered milk that is not fat free and finally found it! Sent it to my cousin away at college and he says it's ok for the taste. Good for late night dorm snacks.
16443,B007TJGZ54,5.0,"I have enjoyed this brand of coffee for several years now and it has been consistent in flavor!  I was happy to see that it came in a 50-count box....with cold weather approaching, I will be drinking a LOT more coffee."
148696,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"Tasty, and healthier than candy bars, but a health bar it ain't (after peanuts, the next main ingredients are corn syrup and sugar).  The bars are currently a little over 50 cents a piece, which isn't bad for something to quench your hunger, which these little bars aren't too bad at.  That said, this deal is for about 5 lbs of peanut bars.  5 pounds of dry roasted, unsalted peanuts (which would be healthier than these bars) would only be a quarter of the price of these.  Maybe the convenience is worth it to you though.  Be aware that these bars do not do well in warm temperatures: the peanut butter they're smeared with gets melted very quickly."
239082,B0083QJUL8,2.0,The label on the syrup does not say grade b I just starting the second bottle and noticed it. I would like to order 4 more but not sure do to the label and it didn't say organic either.
136471,B006Q820X0,1.0,"Grounds everywhere . Poor packaging. One or more K Cups must have opened as most are covered in coffee grounds. Will think before purchasing from this company in the future. The coffee was good, but not worth the mess."
17745,B000Z978SS,5.0,"I use erythritol for low carb baking on a regular basis. It is the only sugar alcohol I've used, but I've read that it causes less gastrointestinal trouble that some of the others. I generally replace some sugar indicated in a recipe with granular splenda and some with erythritol. The combination works well."
17292,B000EVIDUY,5.0,"These are the best brownies I've ever had.  Including the ones I used to make from scratch back when I could still eat wheat.<br /><br />I serve them to my family and friends all the time, they're a staple in my cabinet.  I bring them to parties, potlucks, and to work, and get compliments constantly.  No one cares that they're gluten-free, except me."
150073,B003YBP6Q0,3.0,"Okay, first, I love GoPicnic stuff in general. This was my first GoPicnic item, and I really enjoyed having it on whatever plane flight I brought it for. The crackers and hummus are absolutely *delicious*, and I practically licked the hummus tube clean. I could've eaten a half-dozen servings of those chips & hummus, in fact.<br /><br />But there's a few downsides, and they really got in the way of my love for this particular gopicnic.<br /><br />First, the hummus tube sometimes opens easily -- but sometimes it's like trying to open an over-glued box of milk when you're a little kid. You keep making dents, but you can't get at what you're after. Or, if you do, you end up somehow making holes in multiple spots and it oozes out of each. The tube could really use some kind of redesign. Both to make it easier to open, *and* to make it easier to get everything out once you *do* pry it open. I'm sure if you're eating it at lunch at your desk you've got scissors and can make short work of the task, but flying in coach you face a far more daunting task.<br /><br />Then, my second beef: The nut/fruit mix. This is, obviously, just a personal taste issue. I'm sure someone, somewhere, likes the mix. Me, I'd rather eat fruitcake. Or collard greens. (As you can probably guess, I don't care for either of those, either.) If I open the fruit/nut mix at all, it's to pick through and find a few bits I like. But that's a waste, and usually a bit disappointing. The desert, a dark chocolate square, is great for you pious lovers of the mystical chocolate -- but, me, I'm a wuss and like my chocolate like I like my women. Milky? Okay, that makes no sense. But I definitely prefer a lighter, milkier chocolate. Oh, and I almost forgot the dried edamame -- another dud for me. Which is weird, because I adore fresh edamame.<br /><br />Do I eat the dried edamame? Or the chocolate square? Or the fruit/nut mix? Yeah, usually I'd eat at least some of it, feeling kind of silly for just eating crackers and hummus when I paid for the whole box. I often peer around at whoever I'm traveling with, hoping/wishing I can get one of them to give the food a whirl so I don't feel like such an uncouth waster of perfectly good food.<br /><br />I'm trying not to vote this too low due to the food choices, because that's a personal taste thing, and I'm sure the components are well-executed. My low score is for the logistical difficulty involved. The best part of the whole meal is the hummus, but I can't *get* to it. And even when I do get to it, I can seldom get it all -- in both cases, this makes me a sad monkey. I hope my three stars aren't unfair. And I hope someday GoPicnic can tweak the packaging, or the lineup, or *something*. I really like the way they do things, so I'd *love* to love this. I just can't, not right now."
168631,B0001ES9F8,3.0,I was disappointed. Expected more Kona flavor than regular coffee favor but I got the cheap dollar store coffee flavor instead.<br />The price was OK.<br /><br />I canceled my Subscription.
78832,B001E5DZSO,4.0,The address is shilshole avenue.  A shill living in a hole; selling you 6 dollar a lb brown sugar over the internet.  ..... Sounds about right.
76938,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"First things first, this granola is TASTY. Straight out of the pouch. And for me, that's a BIG bonus since that's how I eat my granola probably 97% of the time. And honestly, I don't really eat granola because it's good for you---I eat it because it tastes good and is *somewhat* healthy (i.e. it's better to snack on this than chocolate cake, LOL).<br /><br />I was also looking forward to more clusters, since the description says ""Crunchy Clusters""--but it was mostly oat pieces and chocolate chunks, which makes it quite hard to eat straight from the bag without a spoon or making a complete mess (I actually took to just dumping it straight into my mouth).<br /><br />All that said, I would buy this again. I received this item as part of the Vine program, so I had no idea how much it cost. One true test of an item is to think how much you would pay for it, and THEN check to see what it sells for. After I tasted it, I thought I'd probably pay $3 to $4 a bag--well, at Amazon's current price, it works out to $3.60/pouch so it was dead on."
77056,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"It tastes like granola with chocolate chunks thrown in, and it tastes good. That aside, the main thing this product is trying to be is natural, which it appears to be. An important distinction, though, is that it doesn't claim to be organic. It seems to me that if I was going ""Back to Nature,"" it would be organic. I don't think I'd pay a premium for this, but it tastes as good as expected."
234301,B000E1HUF8,2.0,"For the Holidays last year, I decided to forgo the legitimate Pumpkin Pie and try something a bit lighter/healthier. I'm familiar with Jell-O's No Bake line, such as their delicious No Bake cheesecake, so I figured their Pumpkin Pie (style) mix should be good too. Well, it's not. At first taste, I thought ""that's not bad!"", but after a few mouthfuls of it, I could barely stand it anymore. There are two main problems I find with it. First of all, the consistency is off, it doesn't really get to a Pie consistency, more like pudding as another reviewer mentioned. I've added less milk (1.5 cups) and that helped a bit with the texture (now more like thicker pudding). Second, in order to compensate for the lack of any real Pumpkin, Kraft put wayy too much ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg or whatever else in there. The pumpkin spice flavor is overly pronounced and upsets my stomach after a few spoonfuls. So now I'm stuck with a few boxes of this stuff trying to figure out how to use it and/or get rid of it.  At the very least, I could use the included crust mixes for another one of Jell-O's better flavors."
247894,B004T3QMD8,2.0,"I really really wanted to love this product. Both my wife and I are fans of pumpkin spice coffee, and we hoped this product would give Starbucks a run for its money. However, all you really get is sugar flavored water. We used 4 teaspoons as suggested and it was too thin and too sweet, so we cut back to 3 and it was just sugary water. We went to five and all that happened is that it got sweeter. Yes, it has a slight pumpkin flavor, but for the most part it doesn't measure up."
76921,B0001AU3OW,4.0,"great teas.  i love the brewer/dispenser.<br /><br />not a big fan of mango melange though, but all others were great!"
123547,B000VMBE8E,1.0,"Lots of people liked these things and I love their crackers but I found these cookies to be disgusting. That is my opinion. I thought they were dry, stale, and unpleasant tasting. I don't think this batch was compromised as they were crispy and broke cleanly when I bit into them. Could be they are just not to be for my liking."
157255,B001E55YXS,3.0,"I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.<br /><br />Two thin slices of pot roast and a pile of overcooked carrots and potatoes in a salty beef gravy. Convenient, yes. Edible, yes. Delicious? Not really."
16453,B007TJGZ54,5.0,"i drink nothing but green mountain k-cups,nothing can even come close to the taste.Everyone should a least try it once."
82250,B000KSVLGO,4.0,"I would give it a 4.5 if the grading system would allow. Taste bud friendly: I love a dark and oily bean and this one satisfies the foodie in me. Pocket book friendly: Buying bulk beans and using super saver helps save money. Environmentally friendly: This last Earth Day I learned about the importance of shade grown coffee; buying it is one small thing I can do to have a positive effect on the environment. Although these are not listed as shade grown beans, after contacting the company I've learned that they are. I like that I can save money, satisfy my foodie nature, and help the environment."
134267,B004AHD22W,1.0,"BRS is neither organic, safe for diabetics, nor does it enter the bloodstream slower than other sweeteners.<br /><br />BRS is an entirely man-made food which exists no where in nature. It is made by harvesting enzymes from bacteria, mixing them with ground rice flour, and cooking the mix to simulate the action of salivary and pancreatic amylase. This is EXACTLY the procedure used in laboratories to study the digestion of polysaccharides.<br /><br />The result of this process is a concoction which consists of large amounts (~50%) of maltose and glucose, with a glycemic index of 105 and 100 respectively. Simply ingesting a teaspoon of this stuff will make your face flush with a sugar rush.<br /><br />Under no circumstances should BRS be taken by anyone with diabetes. It will almost certainly result in hyperglycemia. Yes, it tastes good, but so does maple syrup, and that is a MUCH, MUCH better choice for sweetening foods.<br /><br />The primary user for BRS is Cliff Bars. Buyer beware!"
16623,B001LGGH40,5.0,"Chill a can of The Switch Kiwi Berry,<br />pour into pretty wine glass,<br />relax and enjoy.<br />Repeat...<br /><br />The Switch Kiwi Berry has an aesthetically pleasing color, tantalizing fruity taste, just enough carbonation, a pleasurable experience. -- Katharena Eiermann, 2009"
16767,B001LGGH40,5.0,"Great taste, solid flavor, sparlking. Good thirst quencher that is a great substitute for soda."
149604,B000E8WIAS,3.0,I had read other reviews on this product and really was looking forward to trying them. I have to say I was alittle disappointed they are really just ok to me nothing fantastic.
237125,B0045G8KJ8,2.0,"I am a long-time consumer of Del Monte canned products, and their 100% Juice Sliced Peaches have been my favorite as long as they have been produced.  It has not been uncommon for me to eat an entire can in one sitting, several times a week.  Not any longer...  Several months ago, this item started sporting ""Improved Taste!"" on the label.  When I first saw this, I wondered what they changed; the ingredient list is short, the way I like all of my ingredient lists: peaches, peach juice, pear juice, natural flavor, ascorbic acid.  (If I could get it without the ""natural flavor,"" that would appeal to me even more.)  I do not know if they have a new source of peaches or juice or ascorbic acid, a new formula for the natural flavor they add, or a new process, but whatever they did, improvement is not a word I would use to describe the change.  My mouth still waters when I think about what used to be, but I am sorely disappointed each time I eat them now.  I do not like the new flavor, and I am left with a strange aftertaste.  This does not happen with other foods or beverages, so this is due to the product, not me.  When my current supply is gone (and I plan to give them away to speed up the process), I will not be buying any more.  Since the change, I have bought them at various times from Amazon, local grocery stores, and discount supercenters, just in case the issue stemmed from certain batches or storage conditions, but the flavor has been consistently bad.  You may not agree, and should not be afraid to try them, especially if you value short ingredient lists, as I do, but I certainly would not recommend buying a large quantity until you know for sure.<br /><br />  Another reason I chose to post a review was to agree with a posting by Rooster Eberle on 8-31-12 informing customers of multiple Del Monte canned peaches shipments he received from Amazon which were dented and dirty.  My July 2012 order of two six-packs was received in the same condition, and I canceled Subscribe and Save on this product because of it.  I threw away several of the cans, and decided I would rather hand-select my cans in a local store.  They were, indeed, in very bad condition.  I did separately contact Amazon about this recently.  Hopefully Rooster will post if future shipments arrive in better shape.<br /><br />  I have to add that I am a long-time Amazon Prime customer who places frequent orders of many types of items, and 98% of the time I am extremely pleased with products, service, and shipping.  I brag about Amazon to my friends, and suggest that they might want to become Prime members, also.  So this is not a case of sour grapes about any aspect of Amazon, just a case of sour peaches..."
17573,B0000GH6UQ,5.0,"I'm angry that I didn't try this sooner.  It beats the pants off of the powdered stuff in pre-measured packets, that's for sure!  I love the hint of cinnamon.  When I made the first batch, I thought that it may have a grainy feel, because it looks a little grainy, but it does not have a grainy mouthfeel at all.  My husband was hesistant (he thinks cinnamon smells like armpits (???)), but anyway, he was in love with it, too.  Wish I would have tried this many years ago!"
17053,B000EMOCTE,5.0,"My boyfriend and I started buying these at the local grocery store, and finally realized that it's way cheaper to buy them here on Amazon with the Subscribe & Save program after buying numerous boxes on every grocery trip! A shipment of 10 boxes typically lasts a month between the two of us. While 10 boxes seems like a lot, each box has 10 packets, and each packet has maybe 8 gummy snacks in it, so it really isn't an overwhelming amount. These make for a quick snack when you're craving something sweet and fruity, but don't have time to deal with a real piece of fruit. I actually saw these at the local Dollar Store and they were more expensive than Amazon's price per bag! If you already enjoy these Scooby snacks, I encourage you to give the subscription thing a try - combine the convenience of having them shipped to your doorstep with the most inexpensive price around, and you're getting a real deal!"
82194,B004AMJ7PS,4.0,"K-cup decaf was as described, and it came with surprising promptness.  We've ordered from this company before and always found it satisfactory."
17644,B003QWN6B4,5.0,I have this Oskri Coconut Original on subscription order and I truly enjoy it.  The size of the bar gives one just enough without over doing on one serving.  I do not want to be without it in my house.  Just enough chocolate to make the little bar perfect.  I do keep it refrigerated whether it is necessary or not.  If you like coconut and like chocolate -- go to it.
154451,B002AQ0OL2,3.0,"This Breakfast Blend is just OK!!  I have been trying to find a K-cup that I really really enjoy.  I'll just have to keep trying.  However, I truly appreciate Amazon's Terrific Service...  Thanks Amazon ~ Keep  up your GOOD WORK!!!"

160114,B004PDK47C,3.0,"I ordered these thinking they'd be a healthy snack.  The flavor and texture are very good and I'd take them over Chips any day.  But if you're looking for a healthy snack I'm afraid you'll have to keep looking.  One bag of these (which could easily be eaten in one sitting) has 21 grams of fat, about 60 grams of carbs, and 450 calories! If you're just looking for a tasty snack, I say get them.  But if you don't want all those calories, keep looking."
136438,B006Q820X0,1.0,"This coffee ruined my 6-month old keurig so that I wound up having to throw out both the coffee and the brewer. It explodes out of the pod like sludge, stopping up the machine and making a filthy mess. I have never experienced this problem with another brand of pod coffee and am now back to Coffee People. Do Not Purchase this Product."
248278,B0002R5Q1Y,2.0,"Some nice pieces in there, some pieces I've never ever heard of and definitely far less than I thought it would be. The amount of candy here should be $14.99 to be fair. It was an ok experience, but wouldn't buy again."
152786,B000FDMLVI,3.0,"We purchased this for a new breadmaker we received since you can't really buy breadmaker mixes in stores anymore. The price is great, they come in a six-pack that is not all that large and we find it convenient to be able to just quickly make a loaf of bread without having to pull out the recipe book and add lots of ingredients.  These make a 1 1/2 pound loaf if you're interested and it is pretty easy to make, just dump in the water, then the flour mix, some butter and the yeast...turn it on and wait! Overall, though, we found the taste to be pretty bland.  There is nothing special about the bread from this mix at all, but they have other flavors that are much tastier in my opinion for about the same price.  If you are looking for plain, white bread, then this will work out just fine."
77814,B001LG940E,4.0,"The Switch bills itself as ""great tasting healthy alternative to soda"" so I decided to see for myself. The first thing I wanted to do was compare it's nutritional facts against another black cherry soda that I drink and this is how they matched up:<br /><br />The Switch Black Cherry (Per Serving)<br />15.7 Calories<br />1.8 mg Sodium<br />4.2 g Carb<br />4.0 g Sugar<br />100% RDA Vitamin C<br /><br />National Brand Black Cherry Soda (Per Serving)<br />14.2 Calories<br />3.3 mg Sodium<br />3.7 g Carb<br />3.4 g Sugar<br /><br />Besides less sodium, the addition of vitamins and no added sugars, The Switch Black Cherry didn't really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone. So when it came to drinking it I was hoping for a nice flavor with this one and I got it.  Even with the main two juices used in this drink being Apple and Grape, the cherry flavor came through very well.  Much better than the Orange Tangerine version.<br /><br />Overall when comparing the two beverages although I was not impressed with the nutritional facts, the taste of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> was preferred! The only complaint would be the obvious price difference ($.03 per ounce vs. $.11 per ounce), but I could see buying this as a treat to have around in addition to other sodas."

134735,B004UJ829S,1.0,Check the per ounce pricing.  The 'tub' of Enfamil newborn is 93 cents per prepared ounce.  The refills are over a dollar per prepared ounce.  I'm all for minimizing packaging waste but Enfamil needs to make it financially compelling as well.
148617,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"Taste wise, These are great. Nutrition wise, That's where this falls shorts. When I Think ""Granola Bar"" Which these are falsely labeled as, I think of something that isn't an almost exact equivalent of a 2 pack of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMG8GU"">Reese's Peanut Butter Cups</a>, which nutrition wise, these are, give or take 10 calories.<br /><br />It's pretty much just a bar of peanuts with Corn Syrup and peanut butter. I'd say Stick with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMFXHU"">Planters Original Peanut Bar</a> or Snickers Munch or just plain Peanut Brittle.

Yea, you just have to try it in order to know."
18053,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"This is amazing stuff especially with Amazon Prime. PB2 + APO + Amazon Prime = almost like home.

124876,B005BHIESC,1.0,Even adding other fruit to this product doesn't make it taste any better.  I was hoping it would.  The aftertaste is even worse.  I've treid plain coconut water and didn't like it.  I don't like this either.

248933,B000F70R9C,2.0,"I ordered this tea based upon it having so many positive reviews. I was looking for a new good black tea and this seemed like it might be a good choice. Let me say it again, if you are looking for good tea then this is NOT what you want. This stuff does not taste like tea at all. It is REALLY sweet (not sure how, there is no sugar or artificial sweeteners). Its as if they just grind up a bunch of cinnamon and put it in a tea bag.<br /><br />If you notice, most positive reviews here are from people who do not like tea normally. Just do not be fooled into thinking that you are buying a quality black tea. I may be a bit of a tea snob, but I honestly cannot stand this stuff and ended up throwing away the entire order because neither I nor my friends can stand drinking it."

It has turned out to be a great reward for many dogs I work with as well as a great reward in numerous situations.  In many performance sports you need to be very careful when rewarding your dog on a practice field that there are no crumbs left behind.  This product is PERFECT!!  I also don't need to worry about my pockets getting eaten out of my pants after training.<br /><br />My advice is to watch the price you pay here!!!!  I buy mine locally at less than 1/2 the price you see advertised here.  Even Petsafe will sell it to you for $8.99 not $13!!!<br /><br />Otherwise certainly a 5 star product!!!!!"

I should really give up the hunt because really Blue is one of the best quality foods around.<br /><br />I thought this maybe a healthy choice for my dog but I was wrong.  When I looked at the back of the package it had the following ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, water, meat and bone meal, propylene glycol, sugar, tricalcium phosphate.....  Just to name a few. I dunno, but that doesnt exactly strike  confidence in me as a buyer.  And as others have said some of their dogs are getting sick, there have been recalls etc with this product.<br /><br />Now, dont get me wrong, my dog loves it. But then again if I feed kids french fries every day they'd love it too.  So that isn't a good measure.<br /><br />I think what put me over the edge is when I opened the container(where I put my dog food) and it smelled processed  and made me gag. The food smelled fake. The same effect does not happen when I buy Blue.<br /><br />It's true you get what you pay for. I'll be sticking to a higher quality prodcut."

It's always a wonderful alternative to use in peanut butter cookies. The kids NEVER know the difference either.
129613,B0001M12TA,1.0,"This product has more, but not twice as much in the container, however you must use twice as much as other brands of sodium free baking powder when you bake with this brand.  This makes it cost twice as much to use. I would not have bought it if I had known that I had to use twice as much of the product. This product should have stated the fact that recipes needed twice as much of this product as you do other Sodium Free Baking Powder. I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN<br /><br />Amazon Verified Review"

254734,B007PA32L2,2.0,I love pumpkin spice coffee.  Any pumpkin flavored food or drink and I'm in.  But this coffee is bad - very watery.  I probably won't even finish the box.
252679,B001EQ5ERI,2.0,"I usually love this coffee, but the last 2 cases I have ordered have both had a very uneven grind.  Lots of grinder dust that chokes my portafilter.  Some of it is also very coarse, so it has been impossible to use for espresso of late.  It does work OK as drip coffee, but it comes out with a lot of fine sediment in the finished coffee.  I am hoping that is was simply a quality control problem, but I am going to wait a while before  buying any more."
250470,B004WSBZAA,2.0,"I disliked the packaging and lack of information on the product itself and had to go hunting around the internet to find more information on how to administer/feed it to my dog. Powders are generally inconvenient and this powder is no exception. If they made it in a chew or tablet it would be easier to administer and less messy. Purely on the sake of time, I won't continue to feed it to my dog on a regular basis. I'm all about preventative care (as he is still somewhat young) but the hassle of the powder isn't worth my time."
17540,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"This was the first coffee I tried on a Keurig.  At first I wasn't a fan.  Then I tweaked the cup size a bit and found a nice blend.  I personally like this on the 10oz setting.  This gives the best balance of flavor and fullness.  The key here is this is a medium roast, even though it is listed as 'bold', it is more of a medium through and through.<br /><br />The flavors are good.  There is a nice tail on this one.  It is a tiny bit on what I consider to be the tart side.  Not necessarily bitter though.  However, I am the only one in my family still drinking this one.  They've all moved on to the dark roast all the time.  For me, I like slightly less strength for my first cup of the day.  Yes, I do drink 3 cups a day... So there is still plenty of time for the stronger cups later on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o flavor<br />o smooth tail<br />o great for 10oz or less<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit on the tart side<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this coffee for smaller cup sizes."

241676,B0081XPTBS,2.0,"My wife and I thought we were doing our baby a favor by going organic.  We switched from Similac to this formula and it's hard to say if the issues we had were because of this formula....after a 10 day half and half schedule we noticed less pooping and violent screaming after eating.  Since this is our first two kids (twins) we can't say if it's the formula but something didn't seem right.  Then a friend emailed about the controversy of the synthetic additives in this formula...do your own research, but we have since switched to Baby's Only (too early to tell if it's cured the issues) and we feel better we have steered clear of the fact we might be doing more harm than good.

With the exception of some prescription formulas, available with approval from pediatricians, only one over-the-counter formula is available without synthetic DHA/ARA, Baby,s Only, an organic product manufactured by Nature,s One in Columbus, Ohio.<br /><br />After today,s official announcement by the USDA, all other organic formula manufacturers will need to remove Martek,s oils from their products, Cornucopia,s Vallaeys stated.<br /><br />In the meantime, The Cornucopia Institute also has filed petitions with the FDA requesting that their Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) designation for the Martek oils be revoked.<br /><br />When Martek,s additives were originally granted GRAS status, it was with extreme reservations on the part of the FDA review panel because of adverse reactions to these oils said Valleys. When we reviewed FOIA documents, we were astonished to find that none of the infant formula manufacturers had complied with the FDA,s request to monitor adverse reactions and perform post-market surveillance of these materials.<br /><br />The manufacturing process for Martek,s oils likely includes genetically engineered organisms and neurotoxic synthetic solvents, which are both explicitly banned in organic production. According documents submitted by Martek to the FDA, the process to make their oils includes growing algae and fungus in a medium that is made primarily of dextrose derived from corn, yeast extract or a hydrolyzed vegetable protein, which is usually derived from soybeans. Given that the vast majority of corn and soybean products in the food supply are produced through genetic engineering, the likelihood that Martek,s DHA and ARA oils are grown in a medium of genetically engineered organisms is almost certain. The use of genetic engineering is, of course, strictly prohibited in organics.<br /><br />UPDATE - Ok we are 10 days in and our twins are much much happier.  We did 3 days of half and half and decided to fully switch to Baby's Only.  The intense screaming after eating has stopped and now both our girls are more regular. They go once every one to two days vs every 5 to 6.  Much less fussy and happier overall.  Was it the formula change or just a stage they went through?  Maybe a little bit of both, but there is no doubt I'd never use Earth's Best again....nothing worse than seeing both your daughters screaming after eating especially when you thought you were buying something good for them....they need to remove that crap from this product."

151431,B000EDDSES,3.0,"I wanted to try something healthy and different.  I've had meusli in Europe. They put little chocolate flakes in theirs and it makes a big difference.  This stuff is not very exciting.  Very little flavor.  Not too sweet, which is good. I wish the oats were baked to make them crunchy.<br />But this is just me :-)<br /><br />Cheers."
82050,B000EMPE7S,4.0,"These are good, nice cheese flavor. If your out of croutons break up afew for your salad, or float them in onion soup. Pretty Good!"
153359,B000E46LYQ,3.0,"I have just gotten the turkey, beef and buffalo from this company. The beef jerky had a highly processed feel and was way way too sweet and was not the best quality meet. The turkey was decent, and for the price pretty good with thicker pieces and not as much over-sweetening. This buffalo is in the middle of the two. This jerky is still way too sweet, but the pieces and meat quality are much better than the beef jerky. I  probably will re-order the turkey, will never re-order the beef, and am on the fence for this one. Worth a try, but be prepared to find it too sweet!"
77004,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Like most Back to Nature products, this is every bit as tasty as it sounds from the description.  The Granola has a nice crunch to it and the dark chocolate tastes rich and decadent. I'd give it five stars if the product weren't so darn crumbly.  Other reviewers have stated that would have liked to see this product produced more as crunchy large clusters and I agree with them.  Over half the bag was reduced to single oat pieces and crumbles of chocolate buy the time it reached me.  That may be a result of the packaging choice to put it in a pouch rather than a box.  it's hard to tell.<br /><br />Even so, the crumbly nature didn't alter my enjoyment of the product too much.  It goes nicely into vanilla yogurt as a stir -in and works equally well straight out of the bag as a snack.  My husband told me he thought the molasses used as a sweetener stood out a bit too much but I didn't think so.  The product is a little on the sweet side but certainly not as sweet as most cereals available today.<br /><br />Highly recommended item but buy with Auto-ship to get the best possible price."
79061,B001EPPIT8,4.0,"This is good but I think that it is very much oversalted.  I bought this because reviews of other brands said that the quality was very all over the place and I can say that at least with this brand I made the correct choice on that front.  All of the pieces were of a good consistency.<br />While I did enjoy them, for about 4$ a bag I probably would not buy these again."

17624,B000CMIYWC,5.0,"I am addicted to this TEA!! I love Yogi Teas because of their inspiring sayings on each tea bag's tag... and this ORGANIC tea is SO delicious! It is so tasty and sweet, there is no need to add anything to it! It is perfect all by itself! I drink at least a cup or two a day of Breathe Deep. It keeps me feeling happy and breathing fabulously :)<br /><br />There is no sugar in it, but whenever I have a craving for something sweet, I just drop one of these tea bags into hot water! No calories, no added flavors or sugars, no guilt and the world is happy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea to anyone interested in finding a tasty new drink that is all natural and ORGANIC!! It seems too good to be true, but Yogi is awesome! Oh yeah, and if you have a head cold or congestion, this tea works wonders as well -- I love drinking it, even when I feel 100% healthy though!"
80288,B004342XH2,4.0,"Back when I made my first cup (last year), it was indeed watery.  I thought how it would be nice if so much chocolate wasn't left in the k-cup after brewing (yes, I removed the foil, to recycle the cup).  I decided to shake the cup before inserting into the Keurig, and I'll remove it and re-insert after twisting it 180, giving it another hole to brew from, which DOES help.  I prefer the taste of this to Swiss Miss or Nestle for sure.  I also add Vanilla or Irish Creme powdered CoffeeMate creamer which thickens it up a bit, or will add some Bailey's or Amaretto after shovelling show.  I like the Dark Chocolate version as well."
17818,B004OKXSXI,5.0,"I'm another one who bailed on this product when they stupidly changed the formula, and now I'm back to my addicted status.  The price on these, when you use super saving shipping, is a little less than local stores.  My Walmart just kicked it up by about 60 cents per can.<br /><br />I wish I knew why I liked this stuff so much!  It's just...unique."
253267,B002TOPOLK,2.0,"Don't like the salmon, the smell of fish is to strong and crumbles that my dogs have to eat it outside.  They like the chicken but can not have do to allergic to poultry. I have not seen beef or veggie sticks by Thinkers."

I gave the Beneful food a try with my dog and didn't care at all for the moist (food dyed) pieces.  Its obviously made, packaged and marketed to attract humans -- certainly not dogs!  Few dogs, if turned loose to fend for themselves, would head for the vegetable garden.  It's not cheap, so spend your money on a meat based food."
150527,0006641040,3.0,"It was a great price, but I can't read it to my class. It is like a little travel brochure."
17768,B001EQ4LAE,5.0,These brownies were easy to make and tasted great!  It's hard to tell they are gluten-free because they don't taste like it.  And I've never seen them offered so cheap as on Amazon.  I highly recommend them.
16992,B003XUJ564,5.0,"Taste wise, it's as I expected for canned ravioli.  Ordered 2 cases and both cases arrived in perfect condition.  No dents and with an expiration date of Oct 2014.  Got each case for a little over $12 per case.  At a little over $1/can, you can't go wrong."

17481,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"I'm no coffee expert but since purchasing our Keurig, I've been trying lots of different kinds of coffees to find an everyday, dependable coffee that tastes great.  Newman's Own is bold without being too bold (I didn't care for the French roasts--too strong for me) and has that restaurant-brewed flavor that's so hard to find.  No bitter aftertaste. It's nutty and delicious with a bit of half and half and no sugar (the way I drink coffee). I purchased these at our local grocery store as the price was a bit better than Amazon (sorry Amazon!). If you like great tasting coffee without your socks being knocked off (by a super dark roast), then try Newman's."
240383,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"The dog and I agree.  She doesn't really care for this food - she'll nibble at it off/on all day; she is typically a gobbler.  According to my vet, dogs need a balance diet of protein-rich meat and carbohydrate-rich starch but, Beneful, like most Purina products is mostly carbohydrates.  This isn't an optimal selection to ensure your dogs nutrition.  My biggest concern is that one of the main ingredients is by-product meal (the parts of chickens that slaughterhouses throw away) - my dog deserves more.<br /><br />The re-sealable bag is awesome - I wish all brands/products had this option."
128689,B000H0ZJNG,1.0,Not worth the money. I received 7 small treats. There are many more quality treats out there for your money-many more. Look around.  Wouldn't even consider purchasing again.
162857,B005P6TCGW,3.0,"Like the product, dislike the tangy orange flavor. Like the cool citrus flavor quite a bit and it doesn't have the herbal lift. Some reviewers comment that it doesnt dissolve easy in cold water. Easy solution: Dissolves well in a little hot water, then dilute to the preferred strength. Used on a 100 km bike ride and finished with energy left over. Product works well."
77727,B001LG940E,4.0,"I like the idea of a carbonated fruit juice.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but I did!  Although being a fan of black cherry soda, I was expecting something a little different.  Generally, when I think ""black cherry"" I expect something with a little more ""bite"" to it than regular cherry.  This tasted more like a concoction of juices just leaning a little more on the cherry side.  Still, it was very good, and a healthy alternative to soda!"
255836,B0026KJPYE,2.0,"This product is way too sweet!!!  Yes, it tastes yummy but is so sweet that my kids don't even want to eat it!!  It's also mostly banana!  From my experience, anything that has banana added makes the fruit way too sweet.  The one's without banana taste great and are well worth the purchase!!"
77086,B001OCKIP0,4.0,This granola is everything you can ask for more.  It is a snack filled with grains and fiber and had added dark chocolate chunks.  It is healthy and natural.  It is delicious and tasty.  One can indulge in this granola without feeling guilty for such an enjoyable treat. It is good.
166056,B0000CDEPD,3.0,"Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it's organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon. I know for the same price, this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods, but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product. It's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they don't make it bigger. Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk."
256533,B003JA5KBW,2.0,"Although it is hard to judge this product with only trying it once, I cannot give any real proof that it does give one energy or the immune system.<br /><br />The taste is tart; although it isn't not bad, it isn't exactly the taste one would seek for a refreshment.  If you drink it down quickly it makes it taste a little better.<br /><br />Considering the price of this product, I probably would not buy it.  It is pricy for a product that is hard to tell if it is working."
131110,B0032FKK4Q,1.0,"Iorder these for my husband. The first order was great. This time the  chocolate was discolored, like they were old.  I would love to keep ordering but I'm hesitant. I don't want to receive old product."
158266,B0033TWCGU,3.0,"I ordered a few different brands, this one is just ok for me. The price is low, however I didn't care for the taste. I prefer a bit sweeter, tangier glaze. I prefer the Crema di Balsamico, it is more expensive than this one, but so much more flavor in my opinion."
79097,B000S6CC9I,4.0,I bought these mainly for road trips with the kids. Just remember to stir the contents well so they taste better.
127398,B005VOONKI,1.0,"Given the name and the talent behind it, I was convinced this would be awesome. Even the description had me sold however it just didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />Since I didn't have a pod brewer, I originally tried brewing this coffee in a standard coffee maker which came out super weak even though I used 3 pods. Then I tried squeezing each of the pods into my coffee cup which made it a tad better but still weak. I drank this coffee black which I rarely do but any creamer would have just ruined it.<br /><br />I also tried brewing it like a tea which just didn't work at all. Eventually I found a pod machine and it was weak just using one pod. After using about 7 pods to try out this coffee and get a desired result, I just gave up. I couldn't get the desired quality and as for taste, it's equivalent to something you'll find in McDonalds. I didn't get a hint of anything else."
77440,B000HDVOY6,4.0,"the package is a very good quatity wize , but the size of the piece itself is small which would not give the effect needed ."
163410,B002PXKB2W,3.0,"After being introduced to these cookies in Ireland in Nov. 2010, I was anxious to find a way of ordering more.  When I found them on Amazon, I was happy, even though they were expensive.  When I received my package, I was disappointed.  The chocolate covering the biscuits had the grey chalky look and when I ate the biscuit it was stale.  I called and they happily sent a replacement...but the replacement was not much better."
245386,B000GFYRHQ,2.0,"I'm a big fan/drinker of Green Tea and a big fan/drinker of Earl Grey, but this tea is a little too Bergamot-y for my taste. It may be because plain green tea naturally has a weaker taste than black tea, and the Bergamot is therefore more evident.<br /><br />After a couple cups of this I decided these two tastes are best on their own."
157407,B0019QT66I,3.0,"Since starting this powder about 6 weeks ago, I haven't noticed any effect on my sleep, but the number of times I have been woken up by leg cramps (a.k.a. charley horses) has diminished considerably. (I'm pregnant, so both sleep disturbances and leg cramps are common.) As to the taste, the powder mixed with water is not unpleasant and doesn't have much of a taste. I prefer to mix it with water, lemon juice, and pomegranate juice -- it's delicious!"
75629,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I drank it before going to the gym and it woke me up, it didn't give me the shakes or jitters like some energy drinks have done to me before. The taste is decent as well, it's bittersweet and similiar to a regular red bull, it's almost like drinking a sparkling cidar without the fizz."
17205,B006JG8ALK,5.0,My 3 children love them. I love them. They are delish with dark chocolate covered almonds. Coconut has such great health benefits. A great way to take advantage of the benefits. My kids think they are candy bars.

17730,B000Z978SS,5.0,"Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.<br /><br />* Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.<br /><br />* Contains virtually no calories.<br /><br />* Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.<br /><br />* Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.<br /><br />* Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.<br /><br />* Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />* Can be used in baking.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.<br /><br />* Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)<br /><br />* In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)<br /><br />* Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)<br /><br />* Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.<br /><br />Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.<br /><br />Definitely recommended."

244604,B002Z08ROO,2.0,"Its too sweet. A lot of people will like it, but it is closer to a soda then it is to drinking straight out of a coconut...which is why people will like it. I will stick to ONE or naked coconut water."

158328,B004CYELWI,3.0,"The eyeballs are great, but when purchasing, I could not find a quantity listed.  Considering a package was $7.30, I assumed the package would have quite a large amount of eyeballs (much more than the 9 pictured).  There were 56 eyeballs in the package, ($.13 each) which (again) would have been helpful to know when I ordered."
129479,B005GYYZUQ,1.0,"I am going to agree with the dirty socks smell.  I actually bought two of these at the store and the first one I threw away because I was sure it had gone bad.  When the second one smelled exactly the same I figured that was actually how they really smelled.  Yuck!  The taste is, um, well I was really hungry so I just ate it.  But it does not taste like Pad Thai whatsoever.  I live in Thailand 6 months out of the year, so trust me I know what real Thai food smells and tastes like - and this isn't even close.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one."
127023,B003JA5KDU,1.0,"I recently gave up drinking soda and have been searching for a calorie-free alternative.  I'm a big fan of Tea2Go, but like most sweet-tasting mixes it has Splenda in it.  So even though I've replaced my Diet Pepsi addiction with watered down tea, I still feel a little guilty about it.<br /><br />So when EBOOST came along I thought it was a perfect opportunity to inject some vitamins into my diet.  And, let me tell you, EBOOST sure did.  I just didn't expect it to blast those vitamins through my tongue and out the back of my skull.<br /><br />You see, the folks who produce EBOOST believe that more is better.  And therefore, something that's good for you in large quantities is even better.  And while we're at it, why not just multiply the good stuff by a THOUSAND, because hey, how can it hurt, right?<br /><br />I take a daily multivitamin already and even the efficacy of a multivitamin is questioned by the FDA.  The reason being that different minerals are absorbed by the body differently, and often require fat in your diet (usually at the time of consumption) to be absorbed along with the vitamin. In other words, just sucking down a vitamin with water isn't going to do you much good.  And, in case it's not clear that this review is going down the toilet, dumping thousands of milligrams of certain vitamins into your system is going to pass right through you.<br /><br />Don't tell EBOOST that.  EBOOST has 1,000 mg of Vitamin C, which is 1,667% the daily recommended value.  Let me repeat: one thousand six hundred and sixty seven percent of the daily recommended value.  And here I thought I was okay drinking a glass of orange juice in the morning! I drank a full eight ounces of water with EBOOST and I'm surprised my head hasn't exploded already.<br /><br />In fact, the only vitamin that EBOOST doesn't include insanely high amounts of is potassium at just 14% of the daily recommended value, because that would reduce the efficacy of the 2,500 mcg of Vitamin B12.  Do you know how much of the recommended B12 daily value that is?  41,667%.  I read the label twice: FORTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT of the daily recommended value.<br /><br />A quick search of several health sites explains how ridiculous this amount is. ""Vitamin B12 supplements do not appear to improve energy or athletic performance, except in people with a vitamin B12 deficiency.""<br /><br />Please folks - if you want to take care of these fragile bodies of ours, drink plenty of water, eat healthy, and exercise. There is no magic formula that will make you healthier except a healthy lifestyle.  There are plenty of other ways to get your vitamins, but EBOOST isn't it.<br /><br />Also, it tastes like metal shavings off a dirty muffler mixed in with an orange rind. But I have only myself to blame -- EBOOST fizzes when you pour it into water.  That's Nature's way of telling you not to drink it."

It arrived within 2 days and was well packed and nothing on it was broken. The product description picture is essentially what you get, I was hoping that the one that I got would have been a little more creatively designed, but it wasn't. It's just a sugar skull with a few random squirts of colored icing squirted all over the top of its head."
238546,B000EONEU0,2.0,"Well, the good news is, it does what it's supposed to, making yogurt thicken to the consistency we tend to like it.  The bad news is, it's not much more than just simply super expensive powdered milk.  I remember long ago when dry milk was a staple that was given out at food banks, etc., and was a super cheap commodity.  Now, it's hard to find and extremely costly, but at least you get a lot of it when you do buy a box of it.  This starter is teeny tiny and makes one batch, more than doubling the cost of the yogurt.  Next time around, I tried a little gelatin, and it worked exactly the same way."

248005,B004T3QMD8,2.0,"I followed the directions which suggest you use 6-8 ozs of water and add 3-4 tsps of product.  The result was a watered down tasteless mess, even when I used only 6 ozs of water and 4 tsps of the powder.<br /><br />I eventually found a balance of water to powder that made a tolerable drink but it didn't have much coffee flavor at all and barely any spiciness.  Not even close to a substitution for the pumpkin spice latte I buy at the local coffee shop.  What's worse, is that by the time I add enough powder, the amount of sugar/fat/additives makes it significantly less healthy.  Even when it's made properly, this is not a healthy option and I would urge anyone to just learn how to make your own latte.  It may take a little more effort but your body will appreciate it.<br /><br />Absolutely a waste of money and an offense to my taste buds.  I ended up throwing most of it away."

It is a pleasant, middle-of-the-road blend, but not the type of K-cup I'll reach for first in the morning.<br /><br />One reason the Vermont Country Blend didn't blow my socks off was that it arrived at the same time we ordered Green Mountain Coffee's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08"">Nantucket Blend</a>.

It contains no added sugars or corn syrup and purports to be a healthy alternative.<br /><br />I found the black cherry version to be fairly tasty and satisfying.  Why not give it five stars, then?  Several reasons:<br /><br />1. the carbonation overwhelms the black cherry taste<br />2. the 8.3 ounce can is small<br />3. the cost of a 24 pack of these small cans is high.<br /><br />I would like to try other flavors to determine if the carbonation problem is prevalent.  A few are apparently available including grape and orange.<br /><br />This is a good idea that could be great with a few changes."

165510,B004K4TQXY,3.0,I have gotten the Traders Joes brand they sells and it's wonderful so I thought I'd try this one.  It doesn't have the depth of flavor that I was looking for.  I was a little disappointed.  Still a good product just not enough smokiness.
253159,B001EQ4IES,2.0,"I bought a jar of this stuff at my local grocery store based on the reviews I read here. It was under $10 and I like the idea of quickly brewing up a cup before I head out of the house. Well, this is a decent cup of instant coffee, and nothing else. These five star reviews must be done by NESCAF&Eacute; employees because anyone that has had a decent cup of coffee wouldn't give this so generous a rating. Compare it to Starbuck's VIA instant coffees and you'll see what I mean. If you are simply an instant coffee drinker then it will suit you fine, but don't expect any of the ""French Roast"" character you'll find in a regular ground coffee. I really wanted to like this coffee, but it just comes up short. Sorry."

128881,B003VIWRCM,1.0,"I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called ""cat"" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers. My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their ""flavors"" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is ""good"" food, I can't imagine the crud you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold."

18073,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"I tried this PB2 after reading about it in the Hungry Girl Cookbook. I was amazed at how wonderful it was. You can tell that there is no oil in the product so it is a little less creamy than real peanut butter. I LOVE peanut butter, but was doing weight watchers and couldnt justify using my points for real peanut butter. With PB2 I could eat peanut butter all the time and not feel guilty! It gets a little creamier when used with warm toast or on an English Muffin.<br /><br />I brough PB2 to work one day and introduced it to my co-workers. They asked to buy the jar I had left! They then ordered SIX jars for themselves. If you dont mind the calories, you might want to stick to regular peanut butter. But if you want an alternative that tastes just like peanut butter without the oil... this is EXCELLANT. I now actually prefer this to real peanut butter!!"
82010,B005N7OCJ0,4.0,I am enjoying this coffee. It's a well balanced and yet subtle blend. Trader Joe's ran out of their pumpkin spice coffee - this isn't as strongly spiced but is a pleasant substitute.
17924,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"So... my preferred breakfast is 9 or 12 grain toast with peanut butter. But at the end of the week that's a LOT of calories and fat. So I started having cereal or oatmeal and I started losing some of the 10 pounds or so that I've put on in the last couple of years.<br />No matter how much I exercised or ate carefully, that peanut butter was doing me in.  Now I mix a bit of PB2 every morning and save hundreds of calories per week-- and I still get to have my preferred breakfast.<br />The taste? Not going to lie- it isn't exactly the same. But it's damn close and was EASY to make the switch. I don't even measure anymore-- just add a few drops of water at a time till I like the consistency. It takes about a minute-- long enough for my bread to be toasted- so no big deal.<br />I'm lazy and always hungry-- but this absolutely works for me.<br />I'm so delighted to have discovered it."
149674,B004HXARPO,3.0,Not as sweet fruits work the best for me when making smoothies using this product. I usually blend protein with this stuff with water and blueberries. If you're looking to really make a healthy drink try mixing in a tablespoon of Green Vibrance with each smoothy.

They'll begin to break down almost immediately.  Every time we'd change out the bag - it had tears and was already falling apart.<br /><br />If you need to change your garbage bag every 2-3 days, you're probably alright.

We are on our way to the vet this morning -- I hope something can be done.  That chicken strip was the ONLY change in his regular diet, so I am certain that his illness is a result of this product.  I strongly suggest that you do not purchase this item.  It looks like some sort of high-quality, natural product, but I believe that's just marketing.  I have contacted the store at which I purchased the treats as well as the company.  I hope that the product is taken off the market and that no other dogs and owners have to go through the experience we've had with Mellow Mut chicken strips."
80919,B0029JW9JU,4.0,"This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12"" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings)."

If you're in the mood for something crunchy but not salty, and want to avoid chemical crap, then this all-natural treat is a good choice.  On the flip side, it's not exactly low-calorie, and it's got a fair amount of saturated fat (no trans fats though).  Munch accordingly."

These are not the same. I thought these would be easier/better for my younger grandchildren to eat than the larger gummi worms, but they don't like them either. Oh well, win some, lose some!"

I think she really liked the moist chunks and seemed to fish them out before eating the rest.<br /><br />So our dog gives it 5 stars but I'm not sure her vet or her health would give it that. The first ingredient in this dog food is corn, not great nutritional content. According to DogFoodAdvisor dot com the next ingredient is ""chicken by-product meal, a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered 'unfit for human consumption'"". And then it goes to corn gluten meal. Dog Food Advisor gives it 1 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />So, although it must taste great, it is not nutritionally great for your best furry friend (or hairless in the case of Chinese Crested!)."

However, I had to have emergency breast surgery when she was 3 months old and she had to take some formula off and on during that time. I chose the Earth's Best brand because I like all of their other products. She seemed to tolerate it fine and we had no issues. Imagine my shock reading the Organic Consumers' email newsletter just now informing me that Earth's Best formula was found to have genetically engineered neutraceuticals (in the DHA). Apparently, Horizon Organic milk does too, which is very angering....if you ask me, if a component of a product has to be GENETICALLY ENGINEERED, that product is clearly not 'organic' and shouldn't carry the organic labeling.<br /><br />The only thing I will say is that the Earth's Best brand is a good brand, and I'm sure this product is still much better than all the conventional brands.....I would still pick this over regular infant formula any day....however, the organic label is misleading in a product that apparently contains GMOs. I don't want GMOs anywhere near my developing child, and until law passes that all GMO food be labeled, I guess you can't even trust organic food now. Buyer beware."

240351,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"Purina has named this dog food Beneful implying the food is beneficial for dogs.  Well.. it is.. to keep them ""alive"" but not much else. I would not feed this product to my dogs on a regular basis, if at all.

Do you think these artificial colors are included as a benefit to the dog?  Now I realize why in the past when a dog had a fecal accident on carpet it stained the carpet so permanently...<br /><br />Ingredients:  Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, tricalcium phosphate, phosphoric acid, salt, water, animal digest, sorbic acid (a preservative), potassium chloride, dried carrots, dried peas, calcium propionate (a preservative), l-lysine monohydrachloride, choline chloride, added color (yellow #5, red #40, yellow #6, blue #2), DL-Methionine, Vitamin E Supplement, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin D-3 supplement, menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of vitamin K activity), calcium iodate, folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.<br /><br />My concerns (alarm!) stems from the primary ingredients being corn (fed to cows to fatten them up before slaughter), chicken by-product meal (it means the discarded portions of chicken - the heads, beaks, feet, feathers, etc is ground together), corn gluten meal (again more corn to fatten up the animals), and whole wheat flour (Really?  Do the dog's nearest relatives, such as wolves or foxes, eat grains in the wild?) which is very well known in Asian culture as being much harder on digestion than other grains such as brown rice.<br /><br />The customer service can be reached at 1-888-BENEFUL for information or questions. My first question is why are they adding the artificial colors, at least some of which are made from petroleum?  The color isn't for the dog's selection...<br /><br />I gave this product a whole 2 stars simply for the packaging.  The zipper seal bag is a nice addition to help keep the food fresh.  I would prefer Taste of the Wild or Hi-Tek came in a zipper seal bag of similar quality."
240327,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"I think this is a good value for quite a substantial amount of dog food, but I can't say that our dog likes it very much.  Truth be told, he seems to prefer a much cheaper alternative to this brand (which also might even be healthier based on the nutritional listings).  This particular mix doesn't appear to be too ""beneful"" after all.  Per usual, corn seems to be the predominant ingredient.<br /><br />So while this may be a good value for the cash-strapped dog owner, I don't expect to be purchasing it anytime in the future."

245840,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"I recently purchased my first Keurig machine, the B60 model (which is wonderful, by the way), and my machine was one of those ""bonus packages"" that came with a small variety sampler pack (12 k-cups). Having gone through most of this fantastic assortment already, I decided to order a variety assortment from Amazon. I read all the reviews -- positive and negative -- and decided to take a chance on this one. It arrived today, and although there are some neat flavors that I am anxious to try, there is VERY LITTLE variety. I ordered the 24-count sampler. Out of these, 4 k-cups are truly unique/limited edition flavors that are not Green Mountain. That leaves 20 k-cups of Green Mountain that either French Vanilla (the majority), Caramel Vanilla Cream, Blueberry or Hazelnut. Luckily, these are at least flavors I like, they are just not all that unique. Probably won't order from these folks again, due to the lack of variety. I was really hoping for more choices, like the one that came with my Keurig (the sampler pack had 12 different coffees from all different coffee companies, some I hadn't heard of and were quite good). I hate to whine, but my morning cup is a very important part of my day! Too bad... if you like French Vanilla with a few surprises thrown in, then this assortment is for you, but not if you are looking for a true variety."
158140,B0014AU4TC,3.0,"I love this tea and buy it in bulk but the last time I purchased 16 boxes and over half were flavored with anise and had a terrible licorice flavor. Apparently quality control is a problem. In addition I received peach tea flavored cherry and thou I love this tea and hate the thought of being without it, fear reordering it unsure of what I will receive, but if you are fortunate enough to actually receive what you ordered, their Golden Mango Tea is out of this world. Good Luck"
148599,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"These bars start out sweet when you first bite into them - almost like you're having a peanut butter sandwich. But then they leave a bitter after taste. On the plus side, it's really very nutty! But that bitter after taste is the main the reason why I don't like this product. And if that matters to you, I wouldn't buy this."
17846,B0001FQVCA,5.0,"Having never had Nutella, the scandal over its advertising made me curious, so I went ahead and bought a sample size. It has a unique taste and it is very good. I'm going to now buy a full size and put it on my morning wheat toast. So take that you haters !"

248481,B00016LZT8,2.0,"I was hoping to use this as a lightweight substitute for some of the cheddar cheese I carry on backpacking trips. It turns out to be poorly suited for that purpose--didn't mix into the food easily, didn't taste like cheese, and didn't feel satisfying to eat like a slice of cheese. Unless I find someone to give it to, I'll end up throwing it away."
163499,B001UJIFRU,3.0,I know this is healthy and really wanted to like it but I have to say the regular coconut water taste better. I try to drink this straight from the package but don't like it. Only taste good when I put a lot of ice into a cup and drink it from there. Compared to the regular vita coco I drank 12 packages within a couple days. This one I am trying to finish it so I don't waste it.
132759,B000O3KMKG,1.0,I ordered ten vanilla beans from this company.  when they came in the mail they were so dried out they would snap in half.  there was no way to use them at all.  It took several emails and three weeks to finally get a replacement sent.  Not happy with halaleveryday at all.  Would never order from them again.
238108,B003JHN8IM,2.0,"We've ordered these bully sticks many times in the past few year and they've always been thick bully sticks as advertised.  This last time we ordered these sticks they are about half as thick as they have been.  Our Jack Russell will go through these really quickly.  I would have sent them back, but she needed something to keep her busy.  If they show up next time as the thinner variant I'll send them back and start ordering from another supplier."
253723,B0011CVFMS,2.0,"I used to love this stuff. I don't know if what I got was the real thing or not, but its nothing like what it used to be.<br />Stubbs Moppin Sauce used to have a clean, sharp, vinigar flavor with a hint of pepper.<br /> This stuff has an over spicy/peppery flavor with almost none of the vinigar flavor.<br /> I have only opened 1 bottle and I had to throw that out. It was pretty nasty. Could be out of date???<br /> Anyway, I can't find this stuff in the stores anymore and the Stubb's website only sells it in combination packs and I don't want to pay for the 2 bottles of stuff I don't want."
17054,B000EMOCTE,5.0,"scooby snacks and fruit gushers are my favorite two fruit snacks. the greens and blues are so awesome, my roomate and i go through these a box at a time. the vitamin c will help your immune system, and they contain no fat. sugar content could be a concern for some but not me. these also contain a minor amount of pectin, a common ingredient in throat lozenges; somewhat helpful combined with the vitamin c if you've got a cold/sore throat."
124897,B005BHIESC,1.0,"I love Vita Coco and have been a big fun of it for a long time. Love the Mango, Pineapple, and most other flavor but few. Most of the time I order the basic non flavor type but decided to try this new kind. Yuck! Such a strange taste to it! Even my teenage son who loves Vita Coco and other coconut waters, refuse to have it so now I'll have to finish it so it won't be wasted. This is the one flavor that I have to force myself to finish, and I rarely come up with the bad flavor like this. Totally not recommended, go for Mango or regular Vita Coco instead!"
154324,B004UH90EQ,3.0,The box is beautiful and the tea looks great but I did not like any of the flavors.  I am a green tea drinker daily and I sometimes enjoy flavored tea.  I think all the flavors had an artificial flavor.  Maybe they would taste better brewed and served cold.
126313,B0012IR4XK,1.0,The product contains cottonseed oil which is almost certainly genetically modified. I won't eat them because of that likelihood.
125161,B0001FUGTE,1.0,"Did not come in a sealed package, but in a small ziploc bag. Will not use it...Also, shipping was way expensive in comparison with the value of the product."
148998,B004Q3LBTG,3.0,"I have been using this device for the last three months. I feed my baby almost exclusively homemade foods (besides those my doctor recommends to buy in a jar), so I do use this quite a bit.<br /><br />It is easy to use and it is convenient. My only complaint is the construction. Some of the materials seem a little cheap (for example, the button panel is starting to come off...it is just a sticker). I'm already having to buy another container because the plastic broke on my first one. I called the company to talk to them about it (because it seemed fishy to me that it would break so quickly under normal use, and there is supposedly a warranty) and I got a machine (during normal business hours). No one returned my call. I truly think that any company who makes things for people with babies need to have excellent customer service because their customers are sleep deprived and short on time. This company doesn't even come close to meeting a high standard. I'd rather pay the $25 for the replacement part than deal with the hassle.<br /><br />So, basically, I like the device but I'm not crazy about the quality or customer service (the latter is basically non-existent at this point).<br /><br />All this being said, I researched several other machines before buying this one. I'm not sure I would go back and buy a different device. At least I can buy replacement parts easily!<br /><br />UPDATE: The replacement part didn't fit as it was a newer model than my machine. However, the customer service department did call me back and shipped me an entire new machine (newer model). Unfortunately, it still seems plauged with some problems. The drive shafts sometimes sticks and the buttons don't work very well. Ulimately, for me, not a worry-free machine."
17782,B000EVMNO6,5.0,"I buy these for my husband every year for Valentine's day... you would think that they could last for a long time, but usually by the end of March he's finished the entire bag!!! I'm not big on gummies, but I have to admit they are delicious! :)"
164551,B007RTR8TS,3.0,"This conditioner does the job. It coats the hair well, smells pleasant, and seems to work fine. After using it rinses out well and my hair feels soft and manageable. I really can't find any superlative things to say about it, it does the job without any problems. I will say that I have an issue with telling which is the shampoo and which is the conditioner because the bottles are almost identical and I always forget which is which.<br /><br />I can't really tell if there is a benefit to using this on my colored hair or not. Everything seems fine with this conditioner, nothing stands out as being wonderful or awful. I did not have any leakage like other reviewers have reported with the shipping of this product. The cost is reasonable, that might be the best thing about this product.  I do like that the product is thick and not a runny consistency, it's easier to apply when I can get it to my head without having it drip off my hand."
254775,B007PA32L2,2.0,"Okay...I should know better than to expect that seasonal delight Starbucks usually puts out; but I hoped it would be close enough to satisfy that yen.  Not even close.  The after taste is a little difficult to take as well.  This one was a total ""dud"" - waste of money!"
152541,B000EM010I,3.0,I bought this as a gift to my Uncle and Aunt who are amazing cooks.  They were very happy to received it.
156731,B000UXBOOI,3.0,"I was looking for some traditional Nori Make but it's hard to come by in the states.  I chose this and was a bit disappointed by how dense the cracker was.  In my opinion, they should be light and fluffy but this was very heavy.  The taste was great, though, and I devoured them in way too short a time."
124657,B002OG4ZBS,1.0,"I read the other reviews thinking this would be a great way to give my son something other than Cheerios while we are out and about. These things are so hard it is ridiculous. I can barely break them into small pieces. I have had various kinds of dried fruit and this is by far the worst. The taste is absolutely horrible. I have bought a ton of stuff from Amazon, but this is the first time I have actually disliked something so much that I took time to leave a review. Don't waste your money."
17299,B000EVIDUY,5.0,"This product tastes great.  The only problem I have it is that my son, who is not gluten intolerant, eats most of the brownies before I get a chance to."
236715,B008YA1NWC,2.0,"I thought it would have more of a coconut flavor, it tasted no different then coffee without flavor. I wouldn't buy it again"
127735,B001BOVE54,1.0,Bought this food because it is healthy.  Good thing I only purchased a small bag to try.  Will go back to my Merrick BC.  They do like that one.
157195,B0001IOSCW,3.0,"Not bad. Unlike the ingredients list advertised on Amazon, there are no shrimp in the mix. I think that's a big part of the flavor, and was kind of bummed out when I discovered it."
17714,B003YBJ9JA,5.0,"I bought this at a store in the area to see if my daughter would like it, not only does she like it, she LOVES it.  She has already drank alot of the bottle.  I'm so happy that she likes since its veggies and juice in one cup.  The reason for leaving this review is because I am on Amazon looking for juice in bulk to see if its cheaper."
16716,B001LGGH40,5.0,This drink had a really good flavor.  I not to sweet or too strong.  A really good refreshing beverage that i would buy again.
17887,B001EO653M,5.0,"I've been using the MOCAFE Azteca for years.  Sweet and a bit of spice.  Mixes easily.  And you can get by with half the suggested amount.  Nothing warms you up faster on a cold, winter day."
17787,B000EVMNO6,5.0,"These were the first ""non-bear"" gummi I tried from Haribo.<br /><br />The quality, price, flavor = exceptional. Even my reluctant DH went crazy for these little froggies. The kids 4 and 3, also loved these little guys.<br /><br />The only minor downfall is that after 4 pounds you start to look at them and get a little ""flavored out"" - so I suggest sharing the joy cause our family of 4 just got a little apple weary. (but finished the bag anyway LOL!)"
77429,B001EQ4RVC,4.0,this brand is fantastic tasting. I have tried other brands but always come back to mauna loa brand. you will totally enjoy these macademias. I purchased these through amazon & the whole process went smoothly. I will buy again with amazon.
123625,B0005ZHCZQ,1.0,"This is an outrageous price on the english muffins, $6.95 and then $6.95 for the shipping.<br />I saw the Today show's segment on this today also, I too had to check it out. But it's not Amazon.com that is selling them for this outrageous price it's the other sellers.  Shopping Shark is one of them. ""Shark"" is right. Outrageous price. Check out the 2 pack price sold by Lil-Big Shots, $6.99 plus $44.15 shipping. These stores are off their rockers. Who ever in their right mind would purchase these??"
167467,B007PE7ANY,3.0,"I LOVE these bars! They marry salty + sweet and PB + chocolate. However, I was really dissppointed to read the ingredient label and dsicover that they do contain milk powder and are NOT dairy free as advertized. If you don't care, definitely buy these. But if you have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy, you should know these contain milk."
248721,B003WNVC7C,2.0,"Tea is great but the k-cup design is terrible.  Just finished my 1st box of 12 and had 33% waste.  In a box a 12, had one cup that was just empty.  No tea, no foil covering.  I had 3 more that made a cups of tea filled with fine tea leaves.  Flavor of the tea is great, but these k-cups just aren't well designed.  Save your money."
125132,B000NY8OLK,1.0,Lindt 70% was easily the best dark chocolate on the market. We tried the new recipe ...once. That was it. I emailed customer service and they said their marketing showed that the new stuff would sell better. And they sent me a coupon for more Lindt.<br /><br />They lost a customer.
256094,B0000E2PX6,2.0,"I heard good things about the seasoning on the radion but when I tried it, I wanted to throw it out, the flavor was unpleasant.  I like a lot of different foods from different countries so I did not expect to dislike it."
16699,B001LGGH40,5.0,"This drink completely drew my taste buds into a hypnotic feeling of bliss.<br />The fruit in this drink tasted like it had been freshly picked from some exotic country, and blended to perfection with carbonation.  Delightful!"
245107,B001E6GFSU,2.0,"The fudge melts easily, too easily, but unfortunately that doesn't equate to good tasting chocolate fudge, if that's even a proper description of the mild flavored chocolate outer coating. The graham cracker cookie has a very weak graham cracker flavor. The cookie is made of crumbs and isn't very crunchy. Freezing them doesn't help much either. Lots of sugar (9g per 3 cookies) and lots of fat (7g, or 1/2 tablespoon per 3 cookies). I ate them, they are still cookies :), but I won't buy them again."
76964,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Very addictive stuff.  The day I bought this I almost finished off an entire bag in one sitting.  Whole grains, no artificial badness, luscious chocolate chunks, good stuff!  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find it overly sweet or chocolatey; I thought the granola and chocolate had a nice balance.  And I didn't feel ""heavy"" after eating it- I just felt happy!  One complaint: why not organic?  It's not cheap, and being organic seems like a no-brainer.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
240378,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"Our mixed breed medium sized dog normally eats most of her food right after her 2 feedings, 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening. When she would eat this food she would come in the next room where we were, almost gagging - like a cat with a hair ball. Plus she would not finish what was in her dish.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the corn meal which is the main ingredient, after all dogs are carnivores, or the funny shaped pieces that are included... who knows but this was not a hit with the 4 legged member of the family.<br />The bag is nice with a zipper closure though - that's about the good we found for this brand."
151500,B001EQ5O4G,3.0,"It's better than average. But I agree that for the normal price ($10/12oz), you can get Intelligentsia or other really wonderful coffee. Regarding price, even the sale price/discount offers don't offer much better of a price than what you can do in the grocery store."
161411,B004W55ZBI,3.0,"The first time I tried these, they were absolutely amazing. The fig-center was slightly gooey, and the cookie was soft. It brought back memories of the gluten-filled fig newtons I had given up 3 years before. I bought a box a few months later, and was sorely disappointed. The fig-center was more like a gelatin rather than gooey and the cookie crumbled with the slightest touch. The only thing I can figure is that the first batch I tried must've been incredibly fresh. I've bought a couple of boxes since then hoping for one that tasted as fresh, but I haven't had any as good as the first one.<br />I like that they're packaged in twos for easy grab-and-go snacks and for portion control. I just have to be careful not to squish the packs in my bag...crumbled cookies! I also like the sweetness of the fig-center, but the oustide cookie part really doesn't have much flavor."
160912,B001EQ5LLC,3.0,"The Roland smoked herring had good flavor and would have earned a four star rating, but they were consistently mushy and lacked the firmness that I highly value in a sardine or any herring.  Every can I opened contained broken or easily broken herring that would fall apart on my fork. Perhaps they were overcooked or something in the canning process leads to this, but Roland doesn't earn my repeat business with the smoked herring."
124149,B000H23ZE4,1.0,"was really looking forward to this shipment--I remember Sapporo from my younger years in San Fran.  Spice packs were everything I remembered and loved but the noodles had a funny ""off"" taste, like the oil they used to fry them was waaaay past prime.  Finally just ripped out the spice packets and used ramen noodles from grocery store.  will not order again."
80122,B000EMD1QO,4.0,"I'm a lifetime fan of Lipton tea so, there was no risk in this purchase for me.  A 20 count box of Lipton green tea bags is $2.99 at the local Kmart which makes the 240 bags in this box, a $36 retail value, a steal at $20.  The only negative in this review is that once brewed, the tea looks nothing like a green tea.  Instead, it has a nice golden brown appearance like the normal Lipton product.  I bought a bottle of Lipton diet green tea as a comparison and found the 1.5 liter bottle to be good, but too sweet for my taste.  Instead, 6 tea bags and four packets of splenda make the same amount of tea, but much more palatable.  At six bags per bottle, I can make forty bottles of a tea that was about $2 retail for just $20.  If you're intent on having a tea that is a pale light green then this product is not for you.  However, it's a good value, if not exactly the product being advertised."
163763,B0047XRLNK,3.0,"I really like hazelnuts.  I ate some of these raw, partially baked, and fully baked, but the same percentage bad nuts.  About one out of ten were bad (old, stale, rancid).

17619,B000CMIYWC,5.0,"I love this tea! Just as another reviewer said, Yogi Tea's Breathe Deep is phenomenally effective for asthma!<br />I recently moved into a rented house where a cat lived for 7 years; I have cat asthma, and have struggled to regain my normal breathing. I still use my Albuterol inhaler when necessary, and check in with my doctor (read: I'd still recommend traditional medicine), but nothing has worked as well as this tea! I've been drinking 3-4 cups/day, and have noticed a substantial improvement -- not just during the rest of the day, but the following days -- even when I drink only 1 cup. No one can underestimate the feeling of being able to breathe freely. This tea is a lifesaver!"
253870,B000H7KS12,2.0,"I was looking for a true Turkish Apple Tea.  Found this when I searched and hoped even though it said herbal apple tea that some of the Turkish Apple Tea taste would be there since it also said product of Turkey. Neither my husband or I could taste any apple flavor---we even tried using two tea bags per cup.  Can't say it is a bad tea as it may be standard for a herbal tea but just not what I would consider an apple tea. The two star rating was for ""I don't like it"" but this is one of those items where personal taste differs from person to person. IF you are looking for Apple Tea as served in Turkey this is not the one you want."
156674,B0006GSQTU,3.0,"This is my first Amazon review; I depend on others' reviews so want to return the favor.  My kids are on a no-food-chemical, thus dye-free diet so I'm happy to have found a natural decorating sugar for them, but wanted to let others know that the color is definitely NOT the deep orange pictured, but a medium-light blush/rose color.  HOWEVER, my kids (and myself) are just happy to have something to decorate their cake/cupcakes with since everything out there contains what I believe are petroleum-based dyes (red #5, yellow #6, etc), and it is a pretty sugar, just not the color I wanted (I have sons, do I did not want pink, which this basically is).  I knocked off one star for the high price ($8.88 for about 1/2 a cup!) and one star for the color inaccuracy."

I have purchased Timothy's from Keurig and now have purchased it from Amazon and the packaging is different. It looks like they have knocked off the packaging. It is close put there are definitely differences which makes me wonder about how safe this coffee actually is to drink. I ordered the Breakfast Blend and the Pumpkin-which tastes fine but I am just a little leery. I think I will call Amazon to find out what is going on. If anyone has any thoughts, please let me know. Thanks."
132712,B000VZ8DJ4,1.0,The flavor in this gum lasts less than a minute.  I couldn't tell if it quenched thirst because it was so tasteless I spit it out.  Total waste of money.
77740,B001LG940E,4.0,"As with other varieties of this product, it tastes as advertised, Black Cherry, but I'm wary of any health claims.  While it may be made of juice it isn't juice and juice isn't as good for you as the solid fruit.  In this small can, only 8.3 oz, there is 130 calories so be wary of that too.  If you love soda pop I think this could be a healthier version but if you don't, don't start drinking this this. Make sure that you like the actual taste of the fruit in question and not a soft drink version because this is the real deal in terms of taste."
136679,B000CQ01NS,1.0,"I am very disappointed in this product. It tastes like nothing at all. If you eat the box instead at least you'll be getting some fiber. If you want good rice mac and cheese, try Amy's in the frozen food section--creamy and delicious!"
162079,B000ER3QM8,3.0,I have a lab-wiemaraner mix and he can devour almost any toy in minutes.  He liked this toy but he was able to chew up the green rubber pretty quickly.  The hard plastic ends get sharp with a lot of chewing. Didn't hold up as well as I thought it would.
157140,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"If I could, I would give this product 3.5 stars.  I do think the flavor is good -- though not exceptional; if you like flavored coffees, you'll probably like this.  The coffee flavor underneath the ""hazelnut creme brulee"" flavor is mild.  The beans are finely ground -- a little more finely than prepackaged beans from Starbucks, for comparison -- which makes this product suitable for drip coffee makers but unsuitable for percolators or any other coffee maker that requires a coarser grind.<br /><br />What prompted me to knock my rating down to 3 stars rather than rounding up to 5 stars is that the packaging is not very good.  How can this be?  There are many, many brands of coffee that use similar, vacuum packed, foil lined bags.  With very rare exceptions, these bags are easy to open without tearing and easy to reseal.  This Melita bag, on the other hand, seemed like it was glued to keep children out.  When I eventually got the glue to give way, the bag ended up with a few large tears around the top, making it difficult to get the beans out of the bag without making a mess."
76686,B0049ULB78,4.0,This makes a nice cup of coffee that holds up well to cream.  It's dark but not bitter.  It tastes like good coffee.  I would buy this again.
166839,B0006U3NIU,3.0,"I was surprised when I opened the box & these Buddy Berries didn't look at all like the photo. They actually look & smell like cat food, small bland tan pellets. So far my dogs don't mind eating them but I won't buy again. Would not recommend to anyone."
77795,B001LG940E,4.0,"""It's just juice, bubbles, and Vitamin C."" Soda-pop lovers need not worry that they are ""sacrificing"" anything with this soda ""alternative."" The can size is  slim (we've gotta watch those calories, after all), but it's all about the taste inside the can. It's zesty, bubbly, and packs a powerful punch. The Black Cherry tasted a bit more like grape to me (it could just be my taste buds) and the aftertaste was a bit harsh. But I will definitely consider buying a whole case."
81832,B005CUU25G,4.0,"Our dog is a hugh White English Bulldog about 3 ft tall and 6 feet long. She loves bacon and loves the flavor of this, but she tries to bite and take the bottle away.<br />The bottle is a roller ball like roll on deodorant, and being a big dog she could choke on this if she did get it in her mouth, which is why we give 4 stars. she loves water out of squeeze bottle and would think this would do better in that type of bottle.<br /><br />I would reccommend this for small to medium dogs, but not for the Mastif breeds."
123470,B0006VB3SG,1.0,The liver product stained the beige carpet.  I would not recommend this flavor. We have tried all kinds of stain remover but to no avail.  Save yourself a lot of head aches and a major problem with ruining your carpet.

Upon opening the box, we first noticed a large tag around the product that stated ""Keep Refrigerated"". The item was shipped unrefrigerated in a simple cardboard box. Upon opening the product package, it was covered in a yellowish slime with white mold spots on it.<br /><br />We contacted the merchant who refused a replacement or a refund stating simply ""We do not offer refunds on grocery items"" - and they closed our request. Fortunately Amazon's ""A to Z"" guarantee saved the day for us and Amazon is refunding. We will not do business with this vendor again. We will instead pay the slightly higher price at La Tienda as we had previously. So much for trying to save a few dollars using another vendor."
132959,B0090X8IPM,1.0,I drink Starbucks coffee at home each morning.  I like a strong bold cup and therefore usually brew the darker roasts.  I am not a huge fan of flavored creamers but on occaision I will get a vanilla flavored coffee at a bagel shop.  I was excited to see Starbucks new line of flavored coffees because I assumed the quality would be just as good as their regular coffees and that the premium price would provide a genuine good hint of vanilla flavor.  I was deeply dissappointed in the strong artificial vanilla smell and taste when I brewed this coffee.  I couldn't even drink it with my 1/2 & 1/2 in it. It was worse than any gas station flavored coffee or instant vanilla coffee beverage I have tried.  The aftertaste was terrible and I had to throw away the remaining coffee.
241089,B008EG58V8,2.0,"I was really looking forward to trying this cereal, as I am getting pretty tired of Cheerios.  Nothing against Cheerios, of course, but variety is the spice of life.<br /><br />Speaking of spices, I thought oatmeal with a dash of cinnamon sounded darn good.  Well, dang, was I disappointed..  It's more like sugar with a dash of cinnamon.<br /><br />I kid you not.  It is not readily apparent from reading the blurb on the box that this is a highly sweetened cereal.  I was anticipating something more subtle in its sweetness: ""Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon is packed with a hearty crunch that wakes you up and has just the right amount of sweetness to help fuel you up to conquer the morning.""<br /><br />I do not generally eat sweetened cereals.  (I just don't care for them.)  However, the first bite had me grabbing the box to look for the list of ingredients.  The box reads ""whole oat flour, whole wheat flour (what?) brown sugar, sugar, maltodextrin, malted barley extract, cinnamon, molasses, salt,"" and then all those additives with polysyllabic names.  You can see that sugar is the third and fourth ingredient.  Maltodextrin is a starch that your body breaks down into glucose (sugar).<br /><br />This cereal contains 9 grams of sugar in one cup - just over two teaspoons.  (According to various sources on the Web, two teaspoons of white sugar weigh 8.4 grams, brown sugar weighs a bit more.)  If you like a sweet cereal, you might like it, but that's way too much for my taste. (See product images.)<br /><br />On the positive side, I bet this cereal would be really good mixed in with a batch of trail mix.<br /><br />Additional caution:  People with wheat allergies, beware."

236613,B008YA1NWC,2.0,I love coconut coffee and I was extremely excited to give this coffee a go on my new Keurig B60. All of the rave reviews made me even more eager to try this seemingly great flavor. Unfortunately this coffee fails to deliver. There is hardly any aroma when it brews and the coffee itself on the smallest cup setting looks and tastes like dirty water with a hint of coconut flavor. Since this coffee was the first coffee I ever brewed in my Keurig I thought the machine was faulty. But then I tried out other flavors and it turns out that the coffee itself is to blame. I usually have my coffee with a generous amount of flavored creamer so for ME to think certain coffees are weak means that it is EXTREMELY weak. I even tried the coffee without any creamer or sugar and it was STILL without much flavor. I will NOT be purchasing this coffee EVER again.
79885,B000F8L4HK,4.0,"I really like these bags of Good & Plenty! They are just the right size for eating and sharing! You get more than in the usual ""theater box"" size and enough to share or put away for later! One nice thing about Good & Plenty is that they'll keep a person ""regular"" (LOL!). If you like black licorice you'll love these (if you've never tried them) and the colorful sugar coating adds just enough sweetness to cut the licorice ""bite"". These bags travel well and are easy to ""smuggle"" into the theater! Enjoy!"

75656,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"No Fear certainly does the ""energy boost"" trick very nicely.  Taste-wise... I generally find Monster and Red Bull to be too sweet: I would rather drink a regular (diet, high-caffeine) soda.  I really like Sobe Adrenaline Rush, which is probably the ""least sweet"" of the energy drinks.  (I also like NOS Citrus, but that's just because I grew up on Mtn Dew).  All in all, since price is an issue with energy drinks, I usually go with what's on sale.  With that in mind, even though it isn't my favorite, No Fear is absolutely good enough that I'll buy it if it's the least expensive option on the shelf."

76088,B006ZU5UEA,4.0,"In the never ending quest of not drinking soda, I've used quite a bit of water additives to make myself enjoy drinking anything other than soda more.  Some of them have been quite effective, others made me go running for the caffeine.  But this one was one of the better ones.<br /><br />Hansen's Natural Berry flavor did taste somewhat like berries.  Honestly I actually thought it tasted more like fruit punch, but it still packed some kind of fruity flavor.  It wasn't strong by any means, but sufficient for enjoying the water.  My only complaint would be that it was a little too sweet, almost cloying at times.  But it wasn't horrific, and as said before, highly drinkable.<br /><br />The ingredients are good in this drink mix.  In one little pack that's is good enough to flavor a standard sized bottle of water, there is natural colorants, stevia as the sweetener and natural flavors.  Admittedly there are a few ingredients that I can't pronounce in there, but overall it's a short list and not nearly as bad as some of the other brands are.  And the whole thing is only 5 calories with no grams of sugar.  Vitamic C is added in too and it claims that it's a 100% of the daily value, although I find myself a little skeptical at that.<br /><br />I would try Hansen's again.  There are a few better out on the market but this one isn't too bad.  And it had a decent taste, which is more than a lot of drink additives can say.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"
78330,B00064VQO4,4.0,"I noticed that a number of reviewers commented on the ""bitterness"" of the Bariani extra virgin olive oil.  I tried out both their 2010 ""early harvest"" (green) olive oil and their regular fall 2010 olive oil.  I found their green olive oil to have a stronger, grassy (they mention the high chlorophyll content, which you do get!) flavor, with a distinct bitter edge and peppery finish.  This would be great for someone who gravitates toward a greener, bolder flavor and perhaps a more adventurous experience.  I found it too bitter for my pestos though it worked just fine with roasted chicken, and I think would be great for dipping bread.  Their regular extra virgin olive oil has a faint bitter, peppery finish, but overall a more neutral flavor -- good all around olive oil and a safer bet for those who are sensitive to bitter or stronger flavors."

What I have read from other users is that 2 tbsp of powder shrinks down to 2 tsp when mixed.  I have NEVER had this happen.  I mix 2 tbsp with 1 (plus a little extra) water and have a large amount (I'm talking 2 full tbsp) of ""peanut butter"" for my sandwich.  I would never put as much real peanut butter on a sandwich as I do this.  So, I don't know if I am doing it wrong, but I find this product to be great for sandwiches, especially if you are watching calorie intake.<br />The price is a little high, but I find it to be worth it."

125524,B0016JKXGU,1.0,"FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO BUY THIS TEA BECAUSE IT IS CHEAP AND ORGANIC, YOU SHOULD RETHINK AFTER READING MY REVIEW, BUY IT IF YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE SMOKE TASTE AND THE OIL FLOATING ON THE TOP FROM THIS TEA PRODUCT; IGNORE MY COMMENT AND BUY THIS.<br /><br />This is actually my first review on product that I have purchased, because it is a shock to me seeing all these great reviews about it when it is the worse tea I have ever had! I agree with the 1 star reviews for the most part, and if I could give it a 0 star I would.<br /><br />I know this tea is cheaper than most of the other organic teas, and being that it is organic, one would expect some high quality tea. BUT THIS TEA IS HORRIBLE. Like many others, I like the idea of it being organic, and to decrease in the amount of chemicals and shit I put into my body. However, yesterday when I made my first cup of tea with this tea bag, there were oil residue floating on the top, and the tea taste like smoke!<br /><br />Today, I told myself, why not give it another try? It might be my cup's problem yesterday. Ah ha! same thing happened, the oil slowly emerge to the top again! And I know it for a fact because I always stare into my cup when I am drinking something. I even conducted several experience with the tea bags by using different temperature water (I guess it is a wise way to use up rest of the tea bags, since I refuse to drink this tea any longer). I was hoping to find something different, but every cup had the same kind of oil residue floating. It is disgusting!<br /><br />Now I am still stuck with many tea bags left, and I don't even know if this cxrxaxp is good for me though it's organic. I will never buy this product ever! I wasted around $5 with tax, but I got to warn you all about this tea. I guess it's worth it? now I wished I would have listen to the other reviewers, hopefully someone will take my words to consideration before purchasing.<br /><br />I saw one of the 1 star reviewer being questioned in comment section, and I don't really care if I get questioned because this tea does taste bad and I am mad about this purchase. Again, this IS my FIRST REVIEW, if you don't think it's reliable that's your own problem and you can go ahead and purchase this tea. Anyways, TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. This is what I observe, and this is my opinion and conclusion."
235959,B000LQOJ32,2.0,"I love chocolate filled with liquor and the Mon Cheri itself does not disappoint. It is the seller and the problematic packaging that gives me the urge to rate it 2 stars. Yes it wasn't FULLY melted when I got them, but the whole thing looks like its been stored somewhere in the desert in Nevada for three days before shipped to me. Yes it came with an ice pack that was supposed to keep it cool, except that the ice pack itself is like a balloon filled with warm water.<br /><br />So apparently, I will not buy from this seller again."
126415,B001PO7FDU,1.0,"This product is an absolute disgrace, and how the company has the gall to call it an infused truffle oil is beyond me.  For a start, this comes in a tin, which is never a good start, and the quality of the oil used for this is appalling.  I believe it is grapeseed oil - given truffle oil is intended as a finishing, and not a cooking oil, any decent cook knows that an almost colorless, high heat oil with almost no flavor intended for cooking is a completely inappropriate choice as the base for an infused oil intended to be served cold.  The end product is pale, tasteless and almost without any aroma, let alone that of truffles.  The presentation in a tin is unattractive and also lends the oil a somewhat metallic taint...just a generally awful product.  I guess they realize that the product looks so bad that if they put it in glass they'd never sell any of it.  The only conceivable advantage of this being a cooking oil would seem to be that you might be able to burn off some of the dreadful chemical taint.<br /><br />There are numerous reviews commenting (appropriately) on the 'truffle aroma' listed in the ingredients....what an absolute crock!  This isn't an ingredient, unless it refers to the fact that a white truffle was waved somewhere in a 5 mile vicinity of the vat of oil, and there is a remote chance that some of it may have floated past. I would also say that any company that sells the number of apparently different infused oils that this company does, is hardly likely to be interested in ensuring the veracity of any one product.  If I could hazard a guess I imagine they all taste very similar, and are all created from the same dreadful base oil.<br /><br />We use truffle oil to finish dishes like risotto and scrambled eggs, so I am looking for something that is infused into a good quality base oil, with nice color, and has an aroma that even if it is not naturally derived (one review suggests truffle flavor never is), it certainly smells like it.  I don't think you can go past the Bartolini brand (available on this site).  It uses extra virgin olive oil as a base, has a small piece of truffle visible in the bottle, which certainly smells like truffle, and it looks and smells great on food, which surely is the point. My advice, avoid the Tourangelle at all costs and give the Bartolini a try instead."

What it doesn't say is that the product CONTAINS tree nuts, jelly beans and who knows what else.  And this is a Kosher product! Likewise the manufacturer site does not mention the additional contents of this product.  Add to that, the nuts tasted somewhere between stale and fowl.<br /><br />I certainly will not purchase another product from Koppers unless I can taste it first.<br /><br />I called customer service, got a refund and threw the remaining 4.5 pounds in the trash."

244210,B0017140ZW,2.0,"Got these steaks as a Christmas gift. Four steaks for 90 bucks could be worth it, but in this case it's a scam. They market these as a quality of beef you can't buy in stores but that is simply not the case. There is very little marbling in the steaks and they are Choice beef at best. But let's not forget that Omaha refuses to actually use a USDA rating for their beef. They just use fancy words to make it sound like you are getting amazing steaks when in reality if they were that amazing they would be prime cuts and labeled as such. Take my word for it and go with a company that offers USDA Prime steaks, there are plenty if you just google it. Also, last time I was at costco they actually had a good selection of Prime strip steaks at a price that is cheaper than these. The only reason I did not rate as 1 star is because 3 of the 4 steaks I received had a larger portion of filet than you typically expect with a t-bone. Still, find the prime and stay away from this low quality but well marketed beef."
124434,B000O5FTYI,1.0,I ordered what I thought was 1.2 lbs in this 6 pack.  My cat loves this product.  That should work out to be 18 oz or 3 oz per bag.

240098,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"The product name and package look so wonderful, so beneficial for your dog.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't so wonderful though.<br /><br />The top ingredients are:<br /><br />* Ground yellow corn<br />* Chicken by-product meal (What does that mean, chicken eyelids and nail clippings?)<br />* Corn gluten meal<br />* Whole wheat flour<br /><br />I've had more than one vet advise us to stay away from dogfoods where the top ingredients are corn, gluten, and animal by-products. The rationale is that the corn and gluten can lead to behavior problems with the dogs, and that the animal by-products aren't the real meat that you want to feed your dog.<br /><br />I gave some to my dog to see how she liked it. I didn't want to upset her stomach, so I mixed it 50/50 with her regular IAMS kibble. I figured she would do like my kids do, gravitate towards the junk food, but she actually avoided the Beneful.

You can use PB2 as others have suggested, but I like it on sandwiches. My entire life I've been addicted to peanut butter, so much so that during college I ate 4 lbs of freshly ground health store peanut butter per week! I find that when I mix 2 TBSP of PB2 powder with jelly and put it on a sandwich it tastes as good as any peanut butter sandwich I've ever had.<br /><br />At 55, I'm blessed to be in great shape and have tried to stop eating peanut butter all together but it's impossible.

We have been vegetarian for 12 years, so I am used to the faux meats.  Some I like, some I don't.  I LOVED Morningstar Veggie dogs, they were my absolute favorite.  Most veggie dogs in the refrigerated section of the grocery store have a ton of onion in them!  These Veja-dogs are OK on taste, but I do not like the texture.  It is A LOT like that of a hard boiled egg white.  When I first got one out of the can I did not want to even try one.  It was squishy and had tiny dark brown spots.  The syrupy stuff they are stored in really grossed me out too.  I have eaten about 5 now and am still not crazy about them.  My son however LOVES them.  He says they are his favorite.  I will try another Worthington veggie dog (Super Links or linkettes) before giving up on the ""canned"" dogs all together.  I hate onions, but I prefer the texture of the tofu dogs found in the grocery store."

Unfortunately this was not the case.  As other reviews said, when you open the package there is a terrible fishy smell, but that is eliminated with a lot of rinsing.  My problem was with the texture of the noodle...it chews like rubber and I just could not get past that.  It has no taste of it's own, so whatever you put with it is the flavor you will get.  I only used my favorite spaghetti sauce so was only using the shirataki noodles as a replacement for spaghetti.  I am so disappointed that these did not work for me."

136031,B005SPQENY,1.0,"This is just a strange product. It comes from Taiwan which might explain a difference in taste but not only did the taste not agree with me, it made me instantly quite nauseous. Maybe I had a reaction to the aloe not sure but I really had to work not to be sick from this. The initial taste is not bad but the weird bitter aftertaste was very off putting and burped up for hours. It has lots of shredded aloe floating in it which I really didn't mind texture wise but I suspect the aloe may have been what made me nauseous. This tiny 11.5 ounce bottle is actually almost 1.5 servings. It is very high in sugar almost 30 grams in a bottle. My opinion, there is no good reason to drink this."
234142,B001EO6E0Q,2.0,"I was disappointed in this product.<br /><br />I tried the included recipe for ""Classic Vinaigrette"" - which consists of olive oil, red wine vinegar, and the salad dressing mix. The resulting dressing was greasy, salty, and overwhelmingly herbal in smell and taste. The herbs were so strong that the dressing smelled and tasted acrid and almost medicinal. Immediately I felt that I'd wasted my olive oil.<br /><br />Then, I tried using the dressing as 1) a dressing for a lettuce salad, 2) a dressing for pasta salad, and 3) a marinade for chicken...<br />1) As a salad dressing, it was pretty bad. Too salty, too greasy.<br />2) As a pasta salad dressing, it was also quite bad. The greasiness was terrible here; it made the pasta slimy. Also, the herbs didn't distribute evenly, so some bites were full of dried herbs, and some had hardly any.<br />3) The chicken marinade was the only success. The excess saltiness is fine in a marinade. And since you discard the marinade, the greasiness and pungency do not ruin the chicken. My chicken came out tender and well seasoned.<br /><br />Finally, I stored the dressing in the fridge for future use -- it didn't keep well at all. The oil coagulated and I had to heat and stir it before I was able to use it again.<br /><br />All in all, this salad dressing mix offers no benefits - it is not very convenient, it doesn't keep well, and most importantly, the dressing just doesn't taste good. Not recommended."

253635,B001E534MG,2.0,"I came home with this brand from the hospital, so I automatically assumed it to be good for the baby.. instead what I found was that my baby would be screaming for more when I did not feed her timingly on the dot, which in turn I found out was because she had basically come off a sugar high and wanted more.  I had switched to an organic brand by earth's best which tasted a lot less sugary and she never screamed for more milk... plus it lasted longer in her belly.  They get around not having to label sugar because it's under 'lactose'... but you need your mommy tastebuds to figure it out.  I would not recommend similac or any other highly sugary formula.."

17602,B000CMIYWC,5.0,"I have had seasonal asthma ever since I was a child and have tried rather unsuccessfully to overcome it with excercise, inhalers and medication.  NOTHING has worked as well as Yogi's Breathe Deep tea.  It's like a miracle:  When my breathing is feeling restricted, I drink a hot cup of this delicious tea before bed and it sends me into a nice, deep sleep.  When I wake up, my breathing is 100% better and I feel great for the next 1-2 days.  That's no exaggeration.  I reccommend this tea not only for asthmatics, but anyone suffering from stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, or just anyone who appreciates a good tea.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you Yogi Tea people!  May your success flourish so I may always keep my cupboard chocked full of your wonderful teas."
77567,B001LG940E,4.0,"I was hoping for a covenient alternative to my usual juice + sparkling water drink that I make for a sundowner every evening, however, this falls short.<br /><br />While the drink is 100% juice, it is not 100% cherry juice.  In fact, the flavours of apple and grape over power any cherry juice flavors. (The cherry was more like an aftertaste)  I personally prefer cleaner, clearer flavours and not juice cocktails. The drink is also slightly too sweet.<br /><br />The upside or downside (depending on what you prefer) is that this is lightly carbonated, just like making your own juice + sparkling water drink at home.  It does not have the heavy fizz that sodas do.<br /><br />The 8.3 fl oz about the size of a liquid cup or a small mug, and is smaller than the typical soda can.<br /><br />The aim of the product seems to be converting soda drinkers to carbonated juice drinkers but it seems to fail in that it is not fizzy enough for most soda drinkers and is too sweet for juice drinkers.  While it also claims to be a healthy drink, the high amount of fruit sugars debates that.<br /><br />I would reccomend you try this drink if you like sweet sparkling juices, but maybe in one of their simpler flavours such as grape."
149262,B000FUOC86,3.0,"Hi. I just wanted to point out two things about these chews. First of all, they are made in Mexico not the USA. Therefore, the ingredient list is misleading when it says ""American"" beef hide because it is meant to make you think that the beef hide is from the United States of America. More accurately, it should read, ""North American"" beef hide to distinquish it from being from Asia (note, the label does not specify the origin of the hydrolysed vegetable protein which could be wheat gluten). Secondly, these chews do not contain chlorhexidine like the ""C.E.T"" brand and this may be an ingredient you want if your dog has peridontal issues. My dogs like these chews and I think they do help to a small extent to clean the teeth. gb"

I have tried several energy drinks in the past, and this one is a good option. It is highly carbonated, and it tasted a little strong to me, but it was not unpleasant by any means. I don't think that it gave a better boost than any other drink, and I don't think that it is the best tasting, but it does work. So for that I do give it four stars.

I figured I'd like it even more without cinnamon so I found these on Amazon and oh my... they are AMAZING!! I have eaten one full pound and have not experienced any bad chips like the one reviewer who said they were musty. My roommate ate the other pound and said one chip was incredibly sour, but all the others were great. The only reason I took off a star is because the packaging did not include nutrition information. It was easy enough to find on livestrong, but I definitely think it should be included. Because the chips are all different sizes they don't give an easy to visualize amount, say 1/4 cup = this many calories.. You really need a foods scale to know how much you're eating but in case its of any use to anyone, 24 grams of chips is 58 calories. 16 g is carbs, and 2 g fiber.<br /><br />I gave some to my dad to try. He grows about 10 different varieties of fruit trees, including apples. He said he's dried apples before and they taste the same as these! He takes care not to use anything non-organic or unhealthy so its good they taste the same! Also for some reason they store better in the shiny bag they ship in. I divided one bag into ziplocs to be able to grab for snacks, and they got sort of soft, whereas the chips kept in the original bag inside a ziplock stayed crispy and fresh."

I agree with others that they are low calorie and small, so they're better than a lot of other dog snacks, especially if you plan to give multiple treats out.

240084,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his food so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Dog liked it and gobbled it up.<br /><br />+ Resealable Ziploc style bag.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Filled with tons of poor ingredients for your dog such as Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, animal digest, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), garlic oil, menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Artificial colors? Seriously? Do you really think the dog cares what color the food is when they eat it? Who are we trying to appeal to here, the dog or the person?<br /><br />- $22 is a bit expensive for a 15.5lb bag.  This food is often much cheaper at big box retailers and grocery stores.<br /><br />- Bag is plastic and currently not recyclable.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food.  However don't we all enjoy food that's bad for us? Unfortunately, that's exactly what this dog food is, bad for your dog. Someone said in a previous review if my dog was reviewing this food it would get 5 stars and my dog would agree with that. Lucky for him I know what's good for his health and PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food isn't it. With so many questionable and downright poor ingredients it's hard to really recommend this food for your dog. I definitely wouldn't purchase it again. Our current food is Nature's Domain Turkey Meal and Sweet Potato which is sold at Cost Co. It contains no potentially harmful ingredients, settles very well with my dog and is only $30 for a 25lb bag. If you're looking for a good healthy food, I recommend Nature's Domain brand or if you want to better educate yourself on what's actually in your current dog food I suggest visiting dogfoodadvisor.com. It's a great site that lists nearly all dog foods, breaks every ingredient and its properties down and gives a final overall rating on the food's quality."

As I try to put my finger on the difference, I think it is this--the Planters product is just too big. If you want a lot of peanuts, this is for you. If, however, you want something a little smaller but with a more nuanced taste and palette, go with Nature Valley or one of the other competitors.  Good luck next time, Planters."

Each treat is about 1"" wide and 1"" to 1-1/2"" in length. Good sized treat for a bigger dog, and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties, these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs, no mess. They smell like the jerky I buy for myself, and have quality ingredients. The shelties love them! I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too, they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.  My parents' little pom-terrier mix has a special place in her heart for anything liver, so these were well received (*snarf snarf snarf*) by that pup too.<br /><br />My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten, so I feed both furkids grain-free everything. Even if he didn't have epilepsy, I'd probably still feed grain-free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way. I don't buy these treats here, I get them elsewhere, but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats, it's a LOT of little torn-up bite-sized treats for my shelties during training.

It wasn't quite as bad as infant formula, but it's not all that far off.  Four years ago, I decided to try this stuff again.  I figured that maybe my initial purchase had been a bad batch or that perhaps the company had changed the formula.  I had heard quite a few good things about this product as well.  However, I had the same experience as I had the first time.<br /><br />I also cannot get this stuff to mix completely.  No matter what tool or method I use, it seems like there are always at least a few chunks left floating on the top.  I also would like to mention that my mixing problems also were not resolved by using warmer liquid.  I'm not a professional chef or anything - but I'd like to think that I'm fairly good in the kitchen.  I'm able to prepare complicated meals and deserts.  I don't know why I can get this product to completely dissolve in water like most people can."
81858,B005CUU25G,4.0,"Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.  If you are unfamiliar, the flavored juice in the container is released each time the dog licks a small ball at the tops of the container; as the ball spins, it gets covered in the juice, which the dog licks off, etc.  So, well done!  My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon."
76970,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"This product is an alternative to eating granola bars. The only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar, whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop, but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want, put it onto a plate, and weigh it on a food scale-- which I doubt most people will do.<br /><br />This is very tasty, and is about the same calories as a granola bar for a similar portion. While some of the pieces are chunks, other pieces are single granola flakes or chips, though this did not really bother me.<br /><br />Much as I like this, since it is not superior in taste to the chocolate chip granola bars that I eat, and since it is just too easy to eat a large portion, for now I will stick with my granola bars. But if portion control is not a concern, then this is a great snack."

Sure enough, I brought her over to where these were ""aerating"" and it was the culprit. (I guess the wind was blowing just right that day).  I have purchased other products from this brand previously with no issues. But whatever this was, the smell was too awful to give to the dog."

The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) ""steep"" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference.

To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).<br /><br />*** I have spoken with the seller who has assured me the tea is not old. You cant make everyone happy flavor wise and this was just not for my palette, I have a feeling it may be due to tea having no sweetener added and I prefer a sweetness to my tea.

164566,B007RTR8TS,3.0,"I started with just the shampoo first and instantly regretted it. The shampoo requires the conditioner for good results.  The conditioner is very thick and feels oily but doesn't leave your hair oily. It definitely makes it very sleek, soft and silky to the touch. It also takes the frizz out of your hair (if you have trouble with that like I do) but doesn't make it limp like some shampoo/conditioner's do. The smell of both the shampoo and conditioner is light and pleasing. It's not fruity or floral. I'd describe it as a very light perfumed scent.<br /> I don't know that I will switch to this shampoo and conditioner exclusively when I run out, but the price and free shipping (with Amazon Prime) certainly makes it appealing. I awarded it three stars because it requires both the shampoo and conditioner to get great results. I like more freedom in selecting my hair care products."

76101,B000BPR1AQ,4.0,"OK, so picaridin is not as effective as DEET and doesn't last as long. Now that we agree on that, lets look at why I rarely use DEET anymore.

DEET has some issues with toxicity/side effects, picaridin has no such problems. So, while I dread putting on DEET, I don't mind at all when I spray down with picaridin.<br /><br />This product doesn't get 5 stars because I have now found 20% picaridin which is even more effective and lasts longer.

Well, maybe it's because I don't eat much processed food, but these chips are so sweet and fulfilling for a snack-type food and I would definitely have noticed such a smell.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because I do think I have a slight reaction to them (eczema that worsens if I use them too many days in a row).<br /><br />But getting the bulk price has saved me a fortune.

I like the almonds and cranberries the best (although those do have sugar so I take it easy), and yes the soy nuts are not so flavorful and might not appeal to all. I see mention in another review about the pumpkin seeds coming from China, a valid concern, but I've been snacking on these for a few weeks and haven't seen any ill effects yet :)<br /><br />In the end, it is all about choice - and there are plenty of trail mixes and nut mixes out there packed with sodium.

It was a little bit too sweet, but I'm hoping other flavors will tone that done a little.  I suspect that the 135 calories for this perfectly sized can is due to the fruit itself, and not added sugar, although there is acerola in it - which is also known as the Puerto Rican Cherry.  That means no added sugar at all.  Try this - I don't think you'll regret it."
77829,B001LG940E,4.0,"I love carbonated drinks. Coke, Pepsi, Red Pop, Creme Soda... I think what makes me prefer them is the carbonation. Somehow, it makes me slow down and enjoy the drink more.<br /><br />However, most soft drink companies are just creating different flavors of high fructose corn syrup mixed with the carbonated water. I don't like that. There's nothing good or healthy about HFCS, and I get enough of it in the various foods I purchase without having to drink several ounces of it every day.<br /><br />This product, The Switch, is a great alternative to regular soft drinks. It's basically just carbonated fruit juice with some preservatives added. It gives me that zing I like in carbonated drinks, but without any of the high fructose corn syrup (of course fruit juice has its own sugars). It's much healthier and tastes great.<br /><br />That's what's good about this item. The only bad thing I can think of is that the cans are TINY. I'm sorry; I'm an adult male, and I can't be satisfied with an 8.3 ounce can of juice. Two cans is about right, and at the price they're asking, that's about a dollar and ninety cents to get close to the quantity of a typical bottle of soda pop (20 ounces). Is it worth the upgrade? Yeah, I guess so, but I would think it would make a 24-pack go quickly in my case. I really wish they'd just package them in 16.6 ounce containers, and then still sell as a 24-pack.<br /><br />This flavor, Black Cherry, does not sit with me well. To be fair, I'm not a fan of cherry juice anyway, but when you introduce the carbonation to cherry juice, it ends up tasting more like cough medicine than a tasty beverage. That's just my opinion, of course, and I'm sure fans of cherry juice will love it. Personally, I would like to see just plain Strawberry, and I'd probably like some other berry choices like Mulberry, Blackberry, and Raspberry. Cherry, for me, isn't the ideal choice, which is why my review of Strawberry-Watermelon gets five stars, but this one only gets four stars. Quality-wise, they're both the same; My biggest grip as concerns this review is this specific flavor.<br /><br />All told, I'd have to recommend this product if you want a fizzy drink without the crud you find in most other soft drinks. This is at least real fruit juice, and while I can't say that carbonated drinks of any kind are ""good for you"", I can at least say that this one is made with good intentions and won't make you feel like you're bloated after downing a couple of them. I'm going to ""subscribe"" to one of their products soon, just to see if I can notice a change in my weight, energy level, and general health by switching (Hey!, See? Good product name!) to something that is a bit more natural.<br /><br />As always, your mileage may vary. I'm sure your taste does."

240060,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"I love the idea of Amazon delivering things like this direct to my door. And my dog Cody loves it, but then again, he'll eat about anything (he's outside this very moment trying to catch & eat Cicadas, so he's not exactly a connoisseur!)<br /><br />However, I have some problems with this product. First, the price is a bit high (currently $21 on Amazon, but only $15 at Target or Walmart).<br /><br />Second, I really question the quality of ingredients. In the first 10 or 15 ingredients, there are only *two* real foods - wheat is #5 and beef is #7. And I'm not even certain that wheat is an essential ingredient. Otherwise it's all filler. Corn is not good for dogs (not digestible for any mammals, actually). Sugar is not good for dogs. Chicken ""by-product"" means ground-up bones, fat, tendons, things like that. And, there are a lot of petroleum-based dyes, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />Most importantly, for about the same price ($1.35 per pound), you can buy the good stuff. For example, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6"">Prairie Natural Dry Dog Food</a> is only $1.48 per pound.<br /><br />My recommendation (regardless whether you feed your pet the cheap stuff or not) is to supplement your pet's diet with scraps from your kitchen. We never ever feed our dog from the table or while we're cooking, but instead we'll peel the fat off chicken or keep little chunks of veggies & keep it in the fridge for his next meal. This will save you money and ensure your dog gets some fresh foods in his/her diet, some essential enzymes, etc."

164535,B007RTR8TS,3.0,"I received this item free for review.  I've got shoulder-length curly, frizzy hair.  Color is put on my roots every 3-4 weeks.  When I ordered this, I just hoped for the best regarding healthier hair.  The temps and humidity have been brutal this summer and I have seen some days since using this where my hair wasn't as frizzy.  Is that due to the shampoo and/or the conditioner?  Hard to determine.  Yesterday it was pretty frizzy again.<br /><br />Been using the product for about 2 weeks now.  Something I did notice a couple of days ago, was that there wasn't as much hair on the floor of the shower as I've been seeing for the past couple of years.  Wow, I wasn't expecting that.  It makes sense since this product is supposed to make your scalp healthier.  But slowing down hair loss is not listed as a selling point.<br /><br />The conditioner itself has a silky feel and a light pleasant scent and my hair feels good when getting out of the shower.  Both the shampoo and conditioner can be stood with the opening down, making it quicker to dispense.<br /><br />Two things I need to mention.  The first is that the item came well-wrapped in plastic, and it's a good thing it was.  There was some leakage with the shampoo during shipment.  Not a lot, but it would have messed up everything else in the box.  Probably better to purchase this from a brick and mortar store to avoid possible loss of product.<br /><br />The second is that in order to see a list of ingredients, you are told to pull up part of the label.  What???  Can you see doing this in a store?  Would you purchase one that already had part of the label pulled back?  I think a redesign is in order.<br /><br />On the whole I'm happy with using the product.<br /><br />Amending my review.  I've been using the product for over a month and I'm torn as to what I think of it.  I am definitely experiencing a lot less hair loss since using it, which is a HUGE plus.  However, my hair doesn't look and feel nearly as good and the color is being stripped out of it with each washing.  I think I'm going to have to stop using it.  I've downgraded the rating from a 4 to a 3."

253278,B002TOPOLK,2.0,"I just received my order of Plato's Thinkers Salmon Sticks Dog Treats in the mail and immediately tried them out on my dog. Unfortunately the product is not what I expected. I train my Labrador in competitive obedience and agility and need a treat that can be given to the dog in small pieces to keep her interested and alert in repetitive training exercises. However, the Plato's Thinkers Salmon Sticks Dog Treats are not really designed as a training treat. The sticks cannot be broken or cut into smaller pieces without crumbling apart. The sticks have an outer smooth skin that holds the inner salmon ingredients together but it falls apart when cut or broken and the inner ingredients crumble out. I bought these thinking they would be like the salmon strips product that a fellow trainer shared with me at our last dog agility class which could be broken into small pieces. Unfortunately the salmon sticks are not the same product as the salmon strips.<br /><br />The ingredients may be great and my Lab does like the product, but the sticks are not for serious dog trainers. Get the strips instead if you want to be able to break the treats into smaller pieces - a real necessity for repetitive exercise dog training."

161759,B005APCTG8,3.0,"Not to be a negative review, but adding some information I learned on this product that I feel should be on the product description for buyers. The information on the package states that the fries should not be given to small dogs. Well, we have a 10# Maltese small dog. Seller was very quick to respond to my question on this, saying that the product is like jerky and should be cut into smaller bits for small dogs. Well, I tried to cut it into smaller pieces, but it is tough stuff. Also, the product is from China. Not a surprise as lots of stuff from China. Other sweet potato fries at local store are from China also. And they say sweet potato jerky on package. I elected to ask Amazon for a refund and they were very prompt to issue a refund. I will go back to my local store and buy the treats I had purchased; the sweet potato fries were soft and moist and no problem for our small dog. These would probably work fine with a larger dog and be no problem for dog to eat."

Love that this is yogurt that doesn't make a mess, doesn't require refrigeration, and is easy to transport. The girls love this when we're out and needing a snack."
75666,B004MO6NI8,4.0,I don't drink a lot of energy drinks but when I do then I normally reach for a NOS because of its great citrus taste. I have tried a handful of other energy drinks and I haven't liked the taste of them at all. No Fear Super Energy has a similar taste to NOS and I really like it as well. I would describe the flavor as a very sweet and smooth grapefruit taste. If you are looking for a sugar / caffeine rush then this will get the job done at the expense of high calorie count. I found that this 16 oz. can will give me a nice boost of energy for 4-5 hours.
77550,B001LG940E,4.0,"Disclaimer: I am a VINE REVIEWER and therefore I received one item of this product for free to review.<br /><br />I have a marketing background and the marketing here is great, ""The Switch"" is an ideal name and with consumers looking for healthy alternatives to sodas, this is a good ""switch"" ;-)<br /><br />This is a tasty beverage made from juice concentrates with no added sugars.  To quench that thirst and you want the feel of carbonation (you know what I mean!) man, this is a good choice.<br /><br />My only gripe might be that it is tiny, just a cup or ~8oz.  It goes by quick.  I have no idea on pricing, again since I'm a VINE reviewer, but it's going to need to be comparable to the price of regular sodas or cheaper, else why make the 'switch' ?  I do wish it came in 12, 16 or 20 oz variants.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor is good with no aftertaste and not too tart, essentially a good tasting soda that is not a soda and it still has carbonation."

I'm sure that's a safety measure, but it's not exactly ""save the earth,"" now is it. The pungent smell was the next clue. It's supposed to taste like passion fruit but it tastes like chemicals---and it probably is. The ingredient list states passion fruit ""flavor."" I only had a few sips, and I cannot get the taste out of  my mouth. The final straw is the globs, and I do mean globs, of aloe vera gel that are floating around, waiting to assault your mouth.<br /><br />With 19 grams of sugar, you'd be better off having a cup of water and a cup of fruit yogurt instead.

133421,B0090X8IPM,1.0,"My wife and I fancy ourselves coffee connoisseurs.  We use an expensive drip-brew machine, cold filters, specially filtered cold water, and fresh fine-ground coffee from Pete's.<br /><br />However, we also frequent Starbucks when traveling, and Seattle's Best, and even [shudder] Java City from time to time.  We have exacting standards which we use at home, but we are fine with (and even enjoy), the occasional cup of Starbucks coffee, etc.<br /><br />With that in mind, I when ahead and ordered this coffee sampler bag from Amazon Vine, figuring it might be an interesting trial.  It was interesting all right, but only in the ""i can't believe they tried to sell that as a premium new product"" sort of interesting.<br /><br />The grounds arrive dried out and brittle, I suspect freeze-drying was the culprit.  The bag is a cheap-seal bag, glued shut, and the feel and smell of the grounds screamed ""cheap.""<br /><br />But, even with those misgivings, I soldiered on.  Maybe the coffee those grounds produced wouldn't be THAT bad ... right?  It is Starbucks after all, they have a MINIMUM reputation they are trying to maintain ... yeah, I was wrong.<br /><br />The coffee produced from these grounds was bitter, acrid, and acidic.  The vanilla flavoring is obviously an additive that was poured on to the beans, and it also contributes to the bitter and acidic taste -- you can feel it in the back of your throat, and curdling the taste buds at the back of your tongue.<br /><br />Cream and sugar mask some of the unpleasantness, but only some of it.  The bottom line is this product is a cheap, freeze-dried coffee bean that has been sprinkled with the cheapest imitation vanilla ""flavoring"" they could find.  I have tasted real vanilla bean infused flavor, and also premium vanilla extract flavor, and this was not it.<br /><br />If you want vanilla flavored coffee, I would say your best bet is to buy quality beans/grounds, and brew them properly, and then add a shot or two of premium vanilla syrup, or keep a couple of vanilla beans in your coffee beans/grounds, and let the flavor infuse directly into the coffee before brewing.<br /><br />Stay away from this offering from Starbucks, it is just nasty."

This tea does not come in the can, as shown in the picture (and they clearly say that). It comes with the 10 tea bags crammed into a foil pouch.  I have no issue with the packaging.  Why I bring this up is that I find it hard to believe that it cost $7.95 to ship it.  The package is very small (about 4"" X 4"" X 10""), it is very lightweight since there is no can (about 11 ounces), and it shipped from the SF Bay Area, which is about 100 mi away!<br /><br />Mighty Leaf: Why do you not sell this product through Amazon the same way you sell many others, so that I could qualify for Super Saver shipping?

It seemed to be easiest to remove while hot but you have to be careful not to burn yourself in the process. Otherwise, it took a lot of force to pull out the attachment.<br />2) It broke after two months - it was the plastic part that helps to hold the middle rotor on the bottom. I didn't use this that often - probably 3-4 times every week since my baby just started solids and there were a few things I just mashed up instead of using the Baby Brezza.<br /><br />I had intended to get this replaced through Baby Brezza but saw that it would cost $10 for me to ship it back to them - since this seemed like poor manufacturing on their part, I didn't want to pay to have it shipped back to them.

I'm also a HUGE fan of black cherry sodas; however, you might be disappointed if you intend on replacing your favorite black cherry soda because while this has a black cherry flavor, you'd definitely miss the extra sugary flavor, thus leaving it to taste like a fizzy black cherry tea.<br /><br />Still, I don't normally drink soda, and there are times that I definitely crave it.

124490,B007ZU3JAQ,1.0,Absolute rip off - I was NOT sent the item as stated and pictured.  I was sent the Creme Latte; which you can purchase at your local supermarket for $6.50.<br /><br />I did not want the Maxwell House Creme Latte; I wanted the original Maxwell House Latte.<br /><br />They are now arguing via email with me; even though my order quite clearly states the product shown for sale here.<br /><br />Be warned - do not buy!
17669,B002Z04RNY,5.0,"Finally! The perfect snack for my little one! My two year old absolutely LOVES these! He's constantly asking for ""bueberries!"" I used to give him concentrated gummy fruit snacks for a treat, but now he only wants Little Ducks snacks. This of course thrills me! The snacks are 100% certified organic, healthy fruit - just freeze dried. I'm happy to give him as many fruit servings as he wants. You definitely will love this product! The other flavors are great too..."
17672,B002Z04RNY,5.0,Purchased these for my neice and she loves them four big thumbs and two little ones up and a big ol' smile of approval. These are a great treat for any child (even the picky ones)
157328,B0019QT66I,3.0,"I bought the ""natural"" flavor, assuming it would be flavorless.  WRONG!  I bought it with the intention of adding it to my morning protein shake but it has a somewhat bitter citrus-y flavor that doesn't work in the shake.  I guess I need to try it just in water and see if I can tolerate it that way.  It's probably a great product/supplement but I'm having trouble getting past the taste.  Probably would have been better to get a flavored variety."
17380,B000UJW0W2,5.0,"My kitty is a little messy so I needed one of these. All the local pet supply stores do not carry these any more. I was happy I found this seller on Amazon.com. Mpw my rugs can continue to be saved.  Product is as advertized. Very durable, I even wash it in the washing machine on cold water. : )"
134238,B001SB291S,1.0,I have tasted many different coffees in many years. This is one of the worst. The flavor is musty and old....... You get what you pay for.
75807,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I was surprised at the taste of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO6NI8"">No Fear,Super Energy Supplement, 16-Ounce Can</a>. It was nice and fruity, and didn't have that chemical almost-citrus taste that most energy drinks seem to have.<br /><br />Because I had evening plans, I drank the No Fear in the early afternoon. The can is two servings, but I did down the whole can.  It wasn't sugar-free, so I thought that the ""rush"" I'd get would be a sugar high, followed by a crash.  However, I drank the No Fear around 2pm, yawned a small bit through the afternoon, and stayed up a few hours past my usual bedtime. I slept well and had no problem waking up the following morning.<br /><br />I was pretty happy with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO6NI8"">No Fear</a>, and would get it again - probably even over another brand."
151973,B002UV50FC,3.0,"Way way too sweet.... had to return the item due to excessively high sugar content.  If available without all the unnecessary sugar added, I would be interested in purchasing again."
80654,B0000E6NM9,4.0,My mother had just gotten out of the hospital so I sent this to cheer her up and boy did it work.  She loved it!  She is a retired nurse so the doctor's kit was just the thing to put a smile on her face and the treats lifted her spirit.
163496,B001UJIFRU,3.0,"I like the Vitacoco drinks but am not as crazy about the Acai/Pomegranate flavor as the others. Otherwise, very satisfying, healthy and refreshing."
76925,B0001AU3OW,4.0,I love that there is no pouring required for this product. There is no mess will spillage or with loose tea leaves. Its great for a quick cup of tea or for a group. I also enjoyed the sampler because i could try out the different types. Cleaning the tea leaves out required filling the pot with water and swishing it around instead of having a tea filter to dump the leaves in one swoop. That is the only set back to this great product.
249574,B001LGGH54,2.0,First and foremost I was very surprised when I saw that this was 100% natural and carbonated when I took my first sip... It was like drinking a strawberry that had about 4 times as much sugar in it than it needed! I could not taste the strawberry at all and I would not recommend this drink to anyone.
81844,B005CUU25G,4.0,"Lickety Stik lickable pet treat from PetSafe are a hit at my house. My dog gets excitement every time I pulled it out.  It seems to be as good as a a moist treat without the sticky mess. A tidy rollerball dispenses all-natural liquid goodness --my dog just lap it up!<br /><br />All-natural flavors, naturally preserved<br />Only 1 calorie in every 10 licks<br />Over 500 licks per bottle<br />No mess roller-ball<br />Great for training<br />Conveniently fits in your pocket"
239836,B000KEPBCS,2.0,"I am fairly  new to gluten-free baking. Since mixing a good gluten-free flour mix is still hit and miss for me, I decided to give this all-purpose mix a try. Even though it bakes quite well, the taste is way too strong, and nothing that I associate with cookie or cake taste. It leaves a bitter, ""beany"" aftertaste that neither me nor my son could get over. We used the flour to make christmas cookies, and unfortunately, the whole batch ended up in the trash because nobody liked them.<br /><br />I'm probably going to try to use the rest of the flour in a savory pastry in the hope that the bean flavor will not be so distracting and actually blend in. Otherwise, I will continue my own mixes, and will continue to look for a good-tasting pre-blend."
240209,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"I tried this product long ago, and couldn't remember how well my three dachshunds liked it. I've been feeding them this for several days, gradually introducing it. I typically mix canned food with their meal at night, give a little more dry in the mornings if they cleaned their bowls the night before. Well, there's lots of Beneful left every morning. I generally feed my dogs Purina Little Bites or Pedigree small breed. This isn't the best dog food or the worst, but I give the what I can afford and I do read the labels. They've all lived to be very old dogs; my oldest is 17, so I must be doing something right. However, they just don't like Beneful, with or without canned food. I think it's a bit pricier than what I usually get also, but not sure about that. I do know my dogs gave this food a bad review."
80727,B000UXVJ02,4.0,"Not quite as thick and flavorful as regular coconut milk, but soooo much more healthy that it's worth it to me. With regular, I only want to use a little bit in recipes and make the recipes less frequently. With this lite, I feel free to indulge in those recipes that benefit from coconut milk."
163982,B00497LNRY,3.0,"Very good product. Take the bare one unless you're ok with something very sweet for the flavored ones. My toddler eats it every morning. The amazon price, $8.5 for 3 packages of 5, is way overpriced. Regular price for one package of 5 at Safeway is $2.5, with promotional price at $1.25 (I stocked up when they were in discount). (I leave in Bellevue, WA, near Seattle.) So unless the price was adjusted by the seller, I recommend that you check your local Safeway first."
17499,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"I drink Newman's own every morning, it is such good coffee.  I also like that I can enjoy a good cup of coffee and at the same time contribute to charities that help children in need.  This is a win-win situation."
17993,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"If you are like me peanut butter is your crack! However, at 200 calories a serving it is a large dietary investment. But with PB2 all worries are put to rest. With only 45 calories per equivalent serving you can't get better than that. I love this product. It tastes and has the same consistency as normal peanut butter when mixed with water. Take my review along with all the other reviews and TRY IT."
17941,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,I have always wanted peanut butter to have alot less calories. I LOVE peanut butter and this tastes GREAT and I'm helping my weight loss at the same time. I  think this is super and anyone wanting to try this you should.
75688,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"The flavor of this energy drink is really good, kind of like a sweet pink grapefruit juice. If you like a drink that tastes more like fruit juice instead of a flavor like Red Bull, you will like this. Although there are added vitamins, Taurine, L-Carnitine, L-Arginine, etc, I didn't notice any ""vitamin-y"" aftertaste. I thought it gave me a good all-day energy boost with no negative side effects like jitters or nervousness. I generally liked most things about it, but thought it was just a bit too sweet. A little less sugar would have made me give it 5 stars. Other than that, I would try this again."
16899,B001LGGH40,5.0,"When my daughter saw that I had a can of this to try out, she said, ""Oh, you have Switch!""  Apparently it's her school's answer to soda.<br /><br />I really liked this product.  It's a very small can, but for the same calorie content as a similar amount of soda, one can have a carbonated beverage that doesn't have added sugar and has some vitamin benefits as well (100% of vitamin C).<br /><br />It was not too sweet, and the flavor was not too strong.  Normally strawberry kiwi is NOT my favorite flavor combination, but I'm glad I tried it.  I would definitely try it again."
136151,B002PNAB04,1.0,"I bought this as a gift and it arrived on time, however, I received a BOX of 36 liquor bottles NOT 48.... the remaining 12 were in a plastic bag all sticky since one had gotten squished in transit. So the gift had to be smaller than what I wanted, thank goodness they didn't stick all 48 bottles in a plastic bag, I guess I should be thankful... but I would NEVER order from these guys again!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!"

17784,B000EVMNO6,5.0,"I recently bought a bag of these on here to try, my fiancee and I love Haribo candy, especially the Gold BEars and wanted to try these...I must say, I usually do not like candy with a marshmallowy texture(like that strawberries and cream type candy) But these are so GOOD! The bottom is marshmallow, and the top is apple flavored gummi. Not too sweet either, just right. Nice and chewy like you'd expect from Haribo candy, I just love them!!!"
18069,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"Not sure what I expected, but certainly not something that tastes darn near as good as peanut butter.  Seriously, other than the ""work"" of having to add some water and measure it out, it mixes remarkably easy and tastes fantastic.  Love this stuff.  I'm ordering the chocolate now too to see how it is."
16952,B0051LNWPI,5.0,"Crazy-great condition, was doing great until my sister accidently knocked it over while I was ""sunning"" it outside. Also, I think using filtered tap water was a bad idea because they're sensitive to salts. It's slowly recovering."
76999,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I do have a soft spot for chocolate, but I like something a little more sophisticated than, say cocoa puffs, not to mention a little more nutritious.  I've tried Special K Chocolatey Delight, which I liked, but I have this habit of occasionally checking the nutrition facts. I found out why they call it ""chocolatey"" rather than ""chocolate.""  The bits in the Special K are mostly sugar and partially hydrogenated oil.  That cereal is also sweetened with high fructose corn syrup and preserved with BHT.  It has some other added vitamins, but I don't really understand the benefit of adding those to cereal vs. just taking a supplement if needed, or better yet eating more foods that contain them naturally.<br />In comparison, I see that this granola has ""real"" chocolate chunks, is sweetened with evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup, contains no trans-fatty acids, and uses only vitamin E as a preservative.  It also has 4g fiber per serving, vs. 1g.  That doesn't magically turn it into health food, in fact this granola has more total sugar and fat per serving that the Special K, but given the choice between the two it still clearly wins on ingredient quality.<br />As for the taste, I like it.  It's simple, without too much going on, and it's sweet enough to satisfy the sweet tooth without going overboard.  The amount of chocolate is just about right as well; enough to find some in most every bite.<br />Overall I'd say it's a pretty good choice to stifle a morning chocolate craving as long as you stick to a reasonably sized serving.  I'll almost certainly be getting some more, especially if I find it on sale."
76848,B0045DLOLC,4.0,This gift bag was filled with great treats for the man in my life.  I just wish you got more for that price.
17802,B000EVMNO6,5.0,"Seriously the best candy ever!  And to make it even better, now you can get them in a 5 lb. bag!!  Gave the huge head sized bag to my wife as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  ""Best gift ever!"" was her response."
245599,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"Flavored coffee sampler is how this product is described.  What I received were 12 flavored coffee's and then an assortment of capuccino,tea and cider.  To be fair I ordered this item one more time and the exact same thing happened.  I also contacted customer service and they sent me out another 24 pack and once again it was the same thing.  They told me they would pull the item from the listing and get it straightened out one way or the other.  I will be looking to see if it is still listed.  I love the idea of trying new flavors but not at the expense of not getting all coffee."
16944,B0051LNWPI,5.0,"I ordered on a Wednesday and USPS tried to deliver on Saturday but I wasn't home.  Picked them up on Monday morning from the post office, and except for one of the pitchers being slightly crumpled, everything is still alive and looks exactly like the picture! I got 4 chutes with a 5th growing in.  Overall a good purchase."
151430,B000EDDSES,3.0,I was searching for muesli like I had eaten for breakfast almost everyday in London.  This wasn't quite the mix.  I think that flax seed tends to add a flavor that I don't like.  The cookie recipe on the package was pretty good.
16496,B000E8Y5CM,5.0,"This is a wonderfully flavored tea. Not too sweet as to be overpowering peach, but enough to help mask the ginger."

The cup I had this morning, I added 3 teaspoons of sugar and the taste was better, but still not one of the better varieties out there. I think a mix with more coffee would have helped. If you've already bought this variety I recommend brewing it with the smallest cup setting. Peace out"
159561,B005GWAAQ6,3.0,"Although the box is described as made of solid wood, it felt rather thin and lightweight. The photo makes it look thicker than it is. In opening the package with a scissor, I accidentally scratched the bottom of the box with the blade, which left a deep indent and showed me how thin it was. Decent for the price but don't expect anything more."
237313,B00284TSTA,2.0,the cream itself is just ok. but the packaging is no good. many are leaking. the packaging is very soft.
130761,B000Z8R63G,1.0,I should have sent these back. Thay were stale with the chocolate coating on the jelly rings white and looked like they were in storage for a long time. The jelly inside was hard and inedible. Never again do I buy from this company. I was embarassed to serve them and threw out.
80339,B000WZPX1E,4.0,Didn't think I'd ever find anything as good as my Holland House dry sour mix packets.  This is equally as good.  I'll stock up for our bar now that I've tried it.
249099,B0032CJYM8,2.0,"I ordered this hoping to get a satisfying fruit snack that was both healthy and delicious. It was a little disappointing. Each packet--though supposedly a serving size of fruit--is in actuality only about one ring of dried pineapple, if that, broken into pieces. I could've done without the added supposed guava flavor--it didn't do anything for the snack. The dehydrated pineapple pieces are basically only flavored by what seems like a dusting of the flavoring fruit--so there's some alteration on the pineapple flavor, but is neither here nor there.<br />It is sweet (almost too sweet) and without added sugars may indeed satisfy some people's (very small...)sweet tooth. Personally, I'd go with bigger size servings--not to mention that it is a waste of resources and energy for packing 5-6 pieces of dried pineapple in each--the rest is air... It is edible, but more much beyond that.<br />I will stick with dried pineapple, non-sweetened, and unsulfured, from the healthfood store."
82119,B001G0N5RS,4.0,I love pickled ginger. This has a little more bite than I'm used to but it still has a wonderful sweet taste. I eat it with sushi or even with a sandwich like olives or pickles. It's good anytime.
81369,B001D67E5Y,4.0,"This syrup is quite delicious with the combined toffee and nut flavors. The flavor does remind me a bit of popcorn though for some reason. If you are looking for a syrup to make the Starbucks Salted Caramel Mocha then this toffee nut is not the same as the one Starbucks uses, it has a distinctly different flavor. It is very good but not quite what I was looking for (hence the 4 stars).<br /><br />My product came in a glass bottle with a metal screw-on lid, but shipped surprisingly well in the mail.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 oz. Calories 80; Sugar 21; Carbohydrate 21."
80115,B007Z5VNLI,4.0,"I've been buying primarily whole leaf, oolong, pu'er, jasmine teas from a wholesale tea market in Beijing (Malian St). Though the price is far cheaper than the Ten  Fu (Ten Ren) teas and other retailers, the discernment in quality seemed questionable. I am a simpleton concerning tea. So rather than purchase $90/kg for the base Assam tea, I went to Carre4 and bought an under $5/box of Lipton Yellow label Black tea 100 bags for the consistant quality."
79746,B0025UCI94,4.0,"This is a favorite of mine, personally, since I had it on a camping trip.  Tastes really great when you ""bake"" it in a campfire wrapped in tin foil.  (or, you can be bold and cook it in the can, but good luck with getting it out!)  Getting the bread out of the can is the biggest challenge, at least when you try to make the loaf ""neat.""  You can't find this product locally where I live now (in Texas), so I ordered it online via Amazon.  I didn't need a case, but the shelf-life of this product is ""years,"" so I'll be stocked for awhile.  This bread is rich with molasses (good source of Magnesium), tastes great toasted with butter, and is quite filling.  A GREAT camping food.  Great with baked beans, and anything one would serve with baked beans... hence, why it's offered by B&M!  Only 4 stars because of the difficulty level of getting the bread OUT of the can!"

75874,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"Normally, I do not care for the taste of energy drinks. Their gruesome typical taste, along with the shakes or sugar crash they normally give me, are just two of the reasons I avoid energy drinks. I do have a teenage son who loves them, however. When I had the opportunity to try the No Fear product, I thought he and I could both see how we liked it.<br /><br />When it arrived I chilled it first, and then tentatively took a sip of it. Usually I get an immediate reaction of distaste to energy drinks, but I have to admit that I liked this one. I took half the can and put it over ice and it was good enough that I would buy this and drink it as a refreshing beverage.  The teen liked it too. We were both pretty surprised that this didn't have the usual shudderific energy drink taste!<br /><br />The only thing neither of us noticed however, was any increase in energy. No thermogenic effect, or increased heart rate or anything of the sort. As a drink though, we enjoyed it."
256256,B001E530A2,2.0,"I opened the snack cabinet in the office today and found something new: Sun Maid Vanilla Yogurt Raisins. I thought they might be a moderately healthy supplement to my boring lunch, so I opened a box and popped a few in my mouth.  The raisins were plumper than the normal desiccated Sun Maid product, but the yogurt coating was sweet but not distinctive tasting and had a weirdly slick texture after being chewed a couple times. Noting this, I idly checked the ingredients while I waited for my tea to warm up in the microwave. Natural California Raisins, check. Yogurt coating... with partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil. Hmm. The obverse of the box yielded the devilish Nutrition Fact I was looking for: One box of these demons contains 4 grams of saturated fat, or 20% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />These things are moderately tasty, but for that amount of saturated fat, I want to cram something absolutely delicious in my cake hole (like cake?).

It's far more cost effective. I'd give this cereal five stars if all the ingredients came from North America. The cane juice and rice bran flour are from South America."

166707,B0001BUMOM,3.0,"Barry Farms will send you excellent grain, flour, etc, and when you compare the price per lb to other products on Amazon, it will seem like the best deal, but BEWARE. The shipping is unbelievable.<br />The short grain brown rice is perfectly fine, tastes fine, has nice texture, but it was absolutely nothing special. I've bought short grain rice in the grocery store that tasted the same, but DIDN'T cost me nearly $18 (after shipping) for 3lbs of it. Other vendors' products will seem high priced until you factor in the shipping, and then Barry Farm Foods is kind of a rip-off.<br />It just wasn't worth it at all.

157090,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"Not much to say about the Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee.  The coffee itself was decent enough, although I thought the hazlenut flavor was a tad strong.  It wasn't the best coffee I've ever had but was decent enough for an everyday brew. That being said, I wouldn't pay $20 for this product again since I consider it no better than average."

On the label I notice that Twining's uses bergamont flavoring.  My other brand uses bergamont oil which is the classic source of the distinctive flavor.  I am leary of ""flavoring"" as it is often used when a company is to cheap to use the real ingredient. I wrote Twinings asking if they use bergamont oil.  There answer was ""no"".  I guess that it why it is inferior to the other brand I am drinking.  Note - I am not comparing a specialty shop blend but another large tea brand at the same price point."

I like a good strong cup of tea, and this was much milder and less malty in flavor than expected. Also, when I opened the bag, the tea leaves were very small, almost like filings; not the ""leaves"" I expected.  Don't know if I just got a bad batch or this was a bad year for this type, but don't think I would buy again.  Will stick to their South African Kwazulu tea- it's delicious."

They were fantastic and quick in processing my order.<br /><br />I am quite fond of rooibos tea from South Africa, which is the only location where GENUINE rooibos tea should come from, FYI. The brand, however, tastes crap. I've gone through about 10 or 12 bags, hoping that it was a fluke. Sadly, it's not. It doesn't taste anything like any rooibos tea I've ever had in my lifetime. In fact, I know this is marketed as the #1 tea company in South Africa. Honestly, though, I had never heard of this brand. Twig and Ouhuis seemed to be pretty popular brands. Of course, most people in SA buy this tea loose.<br /><br />In terms of mass marketing, this would probably be on par with Red Rose brand tea here in the States in terms of quality.<br /><br />I hope this helps!"

17440,B0045Z6K50,5.0,This coffee is good quality. It is a strong medium roast with slight acidity but not overwhelming acidity. The extra bold means that the K cup has more ground coffee in it. It does not refer to the type of roast but rather the amount of coffee in the k cup. The cups are almost completely full of coffee. It's a good wake up cup of coffee for the morning and it is organic too! I find that the 8 oz. setting on my brewer makes just the right cup. Those who like their coffee weaker might like a 10 oz. setting. I would recommend this coffee if you can get it at a reasonable price.

That said, I decided to get this when it showed up on Vine and brought it into the office to share with everyone and see what they thought - and the opinions were all over the board. The boss hated it, but he doesn't like the flavored stuff at all. The lads at the sales counter were thumbs up (of course, after the Folgers they usually get anything's a treat).<br /><br />Me, I'm kind of *meh*. I picked up on a sharp, bitter taste and while it was OK enough it didn't bowl me over. I prefer to stick with freshly ground Starbucks with a vanilla flavoring added to sweeten the pot. And since I can't have that I'll stick with my morning tea. Two stars from the boss and I, four from the lads, rounded out to three."
77003,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I can't really add too much to the other reviews; I received the product yesterday, and immediately tore into the bag.  From the first mouthful, it was clear this is a tasty product.  As someone who likes granola anyway, and who is a chocoholic (especially dark chocolate), it was a winner.  The only real complaint (and it's a minor one) is the fact that it's too crumbly.  As someone else noted, bigger chunks would be an improvement.  It was a bit difficult to scoop out without dropping some (although my cats liked to pounce on the pieces as they hit the floor).  Given this, it probably is better served being added to yogurt or sprinkled on fruit.  All in all, this is a really good product."

136063,B005SPQENY,1.0,"Normally I enjoy a good green tea - I am aware that the nutritional value of these drinks is questionable but taste is relative.<br /><br />In this case I couldn't get past two things: the smell, passion fruit is not a pleasant scent to me, particularly artificial passion fruit. Second, I only got one sip of this stuff down. The aloe vera floaties & taste completely overides whatever sweeteners & artificial flavors they injected into this drink.<br /><br />Indeed it is kind of a slimy, gelantinous texture (the floaties are in perpetual suspension - there is NO settling to the bottom.!) with an odd funky flavor with an unfortunate after taste.<br /><br />I could not finish it nor can I recommend it."
75699,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"This is a new, nice energy supplement drink that can please folks wanting a quick Energy Pick-Up.  It comes in 16 oz. cans containing Arginine, Taurine, and L-Carnitine. The taste is interesting and the product does seem to pick you up.  It contains a HUGE array of desirable supplements, from Sugars, to Folic Acid, To Vitamin B12, Caffeine, and much, much more !!  It's fairly priced, equivalent to products in its class.  If you want a ""pick-me-up"" in the afternoon, this would probably fit your needs !!"
154415,B002AQ0OL2,3.0,"I don't normally drink strong coffee, so this variety was good for me. Good flavor, but not too strong or bitter. The only down side is that several k-cups (probably 6 or 7 out of the first 2/3 of the box) failed and left an excessive amount of grounds in the brewed coffee. If not for that, it would be 4 stars.<br /><br />At the price I paid ($27.75) it is a pretty good value as well."

249137,B004TPKAN4,2.0,I generally enjoy ginger cookies but these were not to my liking.  The ginger was very strong which is probably a plus to some people but I prefer a more subtle flavor.  The biggest problem was they were incredibly hard (break-a-tooth hard) and seemed a bit burnt.  My daughter (age 21) also tried them and thought they were awful.
17868,B001SB60UO,5.0,"I love this product.  Being sugar free is wonderful and best of all, it is thick and taste very good.  I have used it over all the veggies both in cooking and freshly steamed.  I could use any product as I don't have a medical necessity - but I use it because of the high quality and taste above all other things I have tried.  Saving sugar calories is a bonus.  Also it is so convenient to just look it up on Amazon and order it without fear of who is handling the deal or any reprisal there after.<br />If you haven't tried it - give it a try - it makes the veggies ""oh so good"" - lol"
77666,B001LG940E,4.0,"As a nursing mom, I can't drink caffeine (it makes my baby fussy), and I'm getting REALLY sick of Sprite and Sierra Mist. So I was thrilled to try the Switch carbonated juices -- sometimes you just want something fizzy!<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor is indeed delicious (though, as some reviewers have noted, there is a strong apple flavor -- apple juice is the first ingredient), but I was shocked to see 33g of sugar on the label. That's a LOT of sugar for an 8.3-ounce can! Ounce for ounce, it's more sugar than Sierra Mist, which really surprised me.<br /><br />So I'll definitely drink this again, but unfortunately, the amount of sugar and the relative lack of nutrients in apple juice don't make it a wildly better choice than pop."
77788,B001LG940E,4.0,"I'm a cherry nut! All the soda I drink has some sort of cherry flavour so I wanted to try this too. Great taste and how can I go wrong with Vitamin C thrown in for good measure?

17934,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"This stuff is great because of the fat and calorie content. It still contains some protein like normal peanut butter which is good. Normally I would say that the added salt and sugar isn't neccassary but in this case it definetly is because without it it woud probably be pretty gross. As far as the texture goes don't expect it to be like full fat peanut butter as the texture is sort of ""gluey"" but not unpleasant. I like to eat it on toast or with red grapes."
254874,B007PA32L2,2.0,"OK, but not the best.  Does not taste all that much like Pumpkin Spice though, pretty dissapointed.  I will not buy it again, but not a complete waste of money."
249208,B004TPKAN4,2.0,"We are fans of Newman's Own brands in this house and my fiance is a huge fan of ginger snaps.  These did not do it for us.  They had a funky after taste.  The cookies were really hard too, quite a snap. The ginger flavor was good, but the after taste was not pleasant."
157227,B0016BU7EG,3.0,"These used to be called ""Chocolate Chip"" and now they are called ""Chocolate Chunk""... I wasn't aware that the ingredients were different until I ordered a case... now they have ""artificial flavor"" in the chocolate chunks instead of vanilla, and they also have ""partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oils"" and ""caramel color"" in the ingredients...I have always preferred Krusteaz products for their short and legible ingredients lists...now I am disappointed!"
157073,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"i had never used Melitta coffee before, so when this arrived, we were anxious to taste it and see. We generally enjoyed the flavor, but it was definitely not as good as other coffees we enjoy."
242641,B000F9Z2C2,2.0,"Ordered this on a whim thru subscribe & save. Cookies were not quality item. Crumbled, stale and overall the taste varied from cookie to cookie. Discontinued the order.

17939,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,This tastes better than peanut better. It is healthier. It is so much EASIER and CLEANER to handle. I will purchase this from now on.
81086,B002CJD78E,4.0,"I've ordered this food before, and it's one of my dog's favorites.<br />This last shipment, however, contained many dented cans, which does not instill confidence.<br />I'd say about 20% were dented, though so far all the food has been fine.  This is an observation about quality control more than it is a complaint, and I'll likely order again."
77633,B001LG940E,4.0,"The Switch, is a refreshing carbonated juice, with no added sugars or preservatives.  It is a good replacement for sugary sodas.  It taste a little like a cross between sparkling water, Faygo pop, and fruit juice, with a surprisingly good flavor and refreshing fizz.  It is a little costly, about 96 cents for an 8.3 fluid ounce can.  However, the extra money you spend on The Switch, you might just save in dentist bills."
18081,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,Love Love Love this stuff! Perfect in protein shakes! If you are in love with peanut butter but not the calories this is the product for you. I love to add a scoop in my protein shakes.  It makes the shake creamy and taste JUST LIKE a big scoop of peanut butter.
17025,B004391I3C,5.0,If you make this one on the creativa with the normal grande intenso option use a second capsule on esspresso and it's really strong yet not bitter.

136979,B002AQP5FW,1.0,"Hands-down, this is the worst tasting and most expensive GF cake mix I've ever had. It's VERY DRY and GRITTY. I was so excited to see that Betty Crocker came out with a mix but it's SOOOO disappointing. This would never pass a taste test with a non gluten crowd. Whole Foods sells a GF chocolate cake mix under their 365 brand and it's far superior to this. But I'm sticking with my homemade recipe."

I got them home and immediately opened one because I have been craving pepperoni since I got here three months ago.  The flavor is awesome.  It's very spicy, but in a good way.  Heat in the microwave for a few seconds to get some of the extra grease out of it."
240375,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"The 15.5 lbs bag of Purina Beneful Original Dog Food is packaged well in a reclosable, easy to open bag.  The colorful food is appealing, and the flavor seemed to be find with our beagle.  However, I have one test to determine if a dog food is right for my dog and it has little to do with a reclosable bag, or color assortment.<br /><br />To evaluate a dog food, look to the ingredients.  The vast majority of dog foods will have corn as the first (and primary) ingredient.  That is because corn is an inexpensive filler.  However, it is barely digestible and has little nutritional value to a dog.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Here is a simple test.  For a week, feed a corn based food to your dog.  Note the amount of waste your dog produces.  Then switch to a meat and rice based food.  You will most likely notice less waste.  Why?  Because your dog's body is using the food, not just passing it through their system.<br /><br />So, despite a great bag and a pleasing look, Beneful is a corn-based dog food.  Keep looking, pet lovers.  Yes, the lamb and rice varieties are going to cost more, however, you will use less so it may even out and your dog will be better off for it."
17482,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"The first time I tried Newman's Own Organic Extra Bold K-cup, I had used 10 ounces of water and thought the coffee to have a nice flavor but a little on the weak side.  Then one day I brewed a cup of this coffee and forgot to set the water level to 10 ounces and with my Cuisinart coffee maker, 8 ounces is the default.  The result was a perfect cup of coffee, absolutely no bitterness, with a nice bold flavor that is not overwhelming.  I just wish it would taste like that with 10 ounces"
17094,B001E95KQK,5.0,"I was a little bit concerned because some of the reviews for the other Cafe Altura Organic coffees are not very good, but I decided to try this one anyhow.  Glad I did.  This is a really great French roast - one of my favorites.  We will be buying this one again!"
136338,B006Q820X0,1.0,"This is an extremely inferior product. Six of the coffee pods were broken open with grounds pouring out of the box. The remaining pods were ALL stale even though the use by date on the box was  December 2012. All went in the trash. I'll never buy from  Brooklyn Bean Roastery again.  Also, I bought two different coffees  (French Roast and  Fuhgeddaboutit). Both boxes of 36 each were in the same sub standard condition."

237610,B001CHFSR0,2.0,"I love mudslides (the real ones), but this coffee doesn't come close to what you would expect it to taste like.  There is a detectable coconut flavor (barely), no choclate flavor at all, and a strange aftertaste that really kills the deal for me.  I really like most of Gloria Jean's coffees, but this one is at the bottom of the list for me."
17700,B000R32F6M,5.0,"Pricey, if you didn't read the side of the tin. These sachets are to be brewed with TWO cups of water, not one. Therefore, you are getting 40 cups of tea with this tin. Hands down the best tea I've ever tasted. I like mine with a pinch of sugar or honey and cream. Just wish it was cheaper on Amazon, I get it at Woodman's Market for $5, every time, no price fluctuation like Amazon. I have a real sweet tooth and this replaces my late-night urge to binge on chocolate. You will not be disappointed with this tea what-so-ever!"

81766,B005CUU25G,4.0,"This is a nice idea for a low calorie dog treat.<br /><br />It looks just like a roll-on antiperspirant, and you have to roll the ball to get it going. One problem is that this is a syrup or other liquid that is pretty sticky and I usually have to get the ball rolling myself each time. Also, once I offer it to my dogs they can get one lick but cannot get the ball moving.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is my dogs want to take the whole thing, not just lick the surface of it. They seem to like the taste because they really grab the whole thing.<br /><br />I think it's a fun idea and it does seem to taste great to them, though I wouldn't really recommend it because of the ball being hard for dogs to roll.

People need to make responsible choices for what their pets eat. It can be inconvenient, but so are vet visits and pet deaths due to poor manufacturing.<br /><br />My GSD did try the Evanger's lamb and rice and the beef flavor, but did not like it very much.<br /><br />Just an FYI: I have changed ALL his food and put him on a grain free diet. I did it for his itchy skin but soon realized that his diarrhea and vomiting/nausea went away completely.<br /><br />I feed him Orijen dry kibble.

238976,B0007DGQHG,2.0,"As soon as the ingredients were mostly GRAINS I read no more.  The first 1-4 should be PROTEIN, not grains. Granted, the first item is 'organic' chicken but after that it is downhill! It's not easy relying on a profit making company to make food for our pets. I make homemade for my 7# dog, but not easy for an 80# dog, who is boarded frequently. Kennels are not equipped with a fridge. DRY is last on the 'to feed' list. RAW is best, but expensive. Saw Dr. Karen Becker on YouTube speak about how to read INGREDIENTS. Read [...] reviews, trying to be sure I am doing the right thing, like all of us. The major food companies are ruthless and deceptive. Our pets are dying prematurely due to vaccines and diet. Research best you can, make food yourself. A dog CAN eat RAW organic chicken backs/wings. COOKED causes bone to splinter. Newman's Organics is full of GRAINS and too carb heavy. Weruva appears to be the best CANNED food, as it is 'human grade.' So far, Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Healthy Holistic Chicken Dry food is the forerunner."

Knowing how much we like the Chicken and the Tomato Parm Bisque, I thought this would be great.  I also love Campbell's original Vegetable Beef soup.  This has almost no flavor.  Understanding that it's a 'drinkable' soup, I didn't expect many pieces of veggies or beef, but I thought the flavor would be there.

It is healthy wholesome rice compared to a mix style box that adds lots of sodium.<br /><br />Recommend to anyone to create a restaurant style quality to your meal.<br /><br />It take 45 minutes to cook, so I start it first thing on the stove and prepare the rest of the entrees of the meal.<br /><br />Amazon also offer this rice at a very good price compare to my local grocery store.  Thank you for an affordable price."
16983,B003XUJ564,5.0,"I ordered this Chef Boyardee Italian Ravioli and was greatly satisfied. First, let's face the fact that this is a can of Ravioli, not from Olive Garden or even home cooked! For a can, it is ever so tasty and full of the ""things"" a body needs. The fact that Chef Boyardee does not have to advertise on TV and still has really high market sells says it all! I am in my 60's and handicapped. To have good nutrition in a can and taste great is awsome! To have it delivered for free(Prime) in two days by UPS right to my kitchen is a miracle! For all thiis, the price is absolutely fantastic! I read all the reviews. My case was shrink wrapped very well and there was not one dented can! The experation date was 2014! I had a case of Libby's peaches in the same box and it was so bubble wrapped, I had to have my neighbor's help to get the wrap off and again not one dented can! Both the Ravioli and the Peaches make great kitchen stock items!"

136480,B006Q820X0,1.0,"thought I would try something new.  unfortunately these do no work in my keurig, I have tried 6 times so far and each time the brew will not go into the cup just builds up pressure and sometimes spills out grounds.  The bottom is pierced so I just don't get it.  I have had a keurig for over a year and never had this issue with any k-cup over multiple brands and yes other k-cups still work fine.  maybe if this issue is acknowledged and fixed I will try from this company again in the future."
79877,B00153SSY6,4.0,"Our cat was on a mysterious vomiting spree for several months -- he threw up partially digested food nearly every day.  Even after blood tests, X-rays, and ultrasound, we couldn't figure what his deal was.  We tried giving him prescription and novel protein foods, as well as different brands of foods, but every morning we'd find that cold, semi-chunky puddle on the floor.<br /><br />We looked around for new foods to try and found Spot's Stew.  Pet foods are hard to pick out, since there doesn't seem to be a very thorough understanding on what's nutritiously suitable for our pets.  Are blueberries and zucchinis any more suitable for cats than corn?  And is it worth the premium?  No clue, but we decided to give Spot's Stew a try.<br /><br />Our cat has been on this food for a couple of months.  He still vomits once every couple of weeks, but it's an improvement from vomiting every day.  The smaller size of the kibble definitely seems to help with digestion.  If the cat does vomit, the kibbles are saturated with fluid; in his other foods, they came out still hard and compact.  No word on whether the special formula helps with the stomach problems.  He seems to adore the taste.<br /><br />Some reviewers said that this food made their cats' poop less smelly.  I have to disagree.  Our cat's poop smells terrible.  It smells kind of cheesy now.  But it's good that this food goes down and out rather than up and out.  We'll stick to this brand."
76752,B0049ULB78,4.0,"My partner was getting distressed with the lack of taste in her K-cup coffee (my bad, since I'm the one who buys the coffee), and she requested something with a bolder taste. So, I tried this. We have used Green Mountain Coffee before, but not this particular product.<br /><br />Bottom line. My partner really enjoys this. The taste meets her expectations. Indeed, although I am supposed to keep my intake of caffeine fairly low, I have also tried this on occasion--and I, too, am satisfied.<br /><br />So, if you want a bolder flavor, this is worth considering."
17123,B000UWRO3E,5.0,Yummmm. Sat at Cafe's along Lago D'Como eating vanilla ice cream with this syrup on top in '01. I fell in love with the cherries and strong taste of cherry syrup....it's a taste sensation...watch out you could get addicted
149587,B000E8WIAS,3.0,I purchased liquid stevia in an effort to use more natural sugars in my baking. I tried simply replacing white sugar with liquid stevia in my favorite recipes. I went to Sweet Leaf's website and used their conversion chart. I found that 1 tsp of liquid stevia for every 1 cup of sugar was too much. The intial taste was ok but had a strong aftertaste that stayed in your mouth for awhile. I later tried recipes specifically calling for liquid stevia. These recipes tasted quite good and typically used less liquid stevia.
77536,B002EYBB3A,4.0,"The tuna itself is pretty good, it's a little dry but tastes good.  It's expensive, but since it's pole caught, that's expected.  Having no salt is a big plus, seems salt, like corn syrup, is everywhere."

Cheap price for coffee but shipping is a ripoff!!!<br />I found the coffee price to be good but the shipping and handling was outrageous.I cost almost as much to ship this coffee as it was to purchase it.Coffee is light ,it should have been very cheap to ship.I could have bought this coffee locally for cheaper. I'll never use this seller again"
82771,B0049K99RW,4.0,"I got hooked on this chai when I decided to give up coffee.  It still has a little bit of caffeine, but much less than coffee does.  It's nice and spicy (you really get the flavor of black pepper) and actually easy to prepare.  Initially, I thought it was too complicated to boil water and then add milk separately, but it allows you to adjust to your own tastes.  I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.  If you want sweet, you add your own sweetener - I usually use a spoonful of white sugar or honey.  After drinking this stuff, I tried some pre-sweetended mix, and there was no comparison.  This stuff tastes ""real"" and without chemicals or preservatives."

80241,B002C58RXI,4.0,"I don't know if the name ""Community Coffee"" is intended to convey a coffee for the masses, but that's kinda how I would rate it. It smells good when you open the package, you use a normal amount to brew, it has a good flavor & aroma. No disappointments, but nothing special. I have a hard time distinguishing this from other typical brands of columbian coffee . . . no worse, no better."

167678,B006BXUZVO,3.0,"I tried Kellog's Raisin Bran, and this cereal is very tasty. There is just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar in the product. When the bran flakes are mixed with milk, I must admit the cinnamon and sugar tastes are awesome.  The reason why I only gave this product three stars is that the raisins and almonds are a little sparse. The raisins are plump and juicy, and the toasted almonds are crunchy and complement the cereal well.  Unfortunately, this cereal is mostly bran flakes. I think Kellog's needs to add more raisins and ramp up the almond content to the amount found in the Honey Bunches of Oats Cereals.  Then this Raisin Bran would be outstanding."
79231,B003TNANSO,4.0,"I really like the flavor of these so I think I am a bit biased in favor of them.  They are a bit expensive, but for a product that has added antioxidants, and is gluten free, i then that's about right to cover the cost. At least this sight offers a great discount. This bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry, especially when you know you are eating something good for your body."
82850,B007TGDXNO,4.0,"Another great coffee from San Francisco Bay. This roast,like their Fog Chaser, are great first morning cup of coffee.  I then switch to their decaf French Roast for the rest of the day. I have used all three of these roasts as a bases for mochas and Irish coffee.  They maintain their flavor very well. Recommend to any coffee lover. Their unique K-cup design uses less plastic which is nice for the environment."

The pill pocket itself was overly oily and had a heavy smell that was difficult to wash off my hands after I handled the product.  After using two pockets -- and not getting a pill into my pooch, I threw away the rest of the bag.  Great idea, but a useless, ineffective, and nasty product.  If you want your dog to swallow pills without a fuss, roll the pill in homemade peanut butter paste (organic peanut butter and nutritional yeast); low-cost, easy clean up, and 100% success rate!"

78957,B001E5E34Y,4.0,"I really love this tea;  am an avid Earl Grey tea drinker. First had this at a restaurant in Southern California and then a funky shop in D.C.  On either coast, it has a wonderful aroma and a good, balanced flavor.  And it's about half the price of other loose leave Earl Grey teas available at the tea chains (Teavana) or local tea shops in my neighborhood.  Overall, great value."
254867,B007PA32L2,2.0,I was a little disapointed in this one.  It really lacked in flavor and was a very weak coffee.  I could barely taste the pumpkin spice flavor.  I would not recommend this perticular brand of pumpkin spice if you are a fan of the flavor as I am.
130633,B001M29OAM,1.0,"$125 for 72 K-Kups.  That is absolutely laughable!!  Come on!!  I hope no one falls for this highway robbery.  There are many many online stores that offer K-Kups from Green Mountain (and other companies) for less than 50cents per cup.  Amazon, and their partner in crime here, are trying to charge close to $2 per cup.  Thanks for giving me a good laugh today."

The chips in these small bags (which were perfect for my lunch bag) were stale and tasteless. Some of the chips were too stale to comfortably chew. I don't know if they are sitting around too long in a warehouse somewhere or they don't do well in small packages, but don't order these chips like this."
167633,B006BXUZVO,3.0,"This new Raisin Bran with Cinnamon and Almonds is the right step in differentiating the class Raisin Bran, but the cinnamon is far too subtle and the almond slices too few to make a significant impact.

I will stick with the sticky kind of honey and try out the honey granules, after I have done much research on the reviews and comments from previous buyers! I would not recommend this product for tea!"
124553,B000UZLQG2,1.0,"I purchased this based on the rave reviews. I am thinking that either I got a bad batch or a lot of people just love the taste of flavorless oil. I am not a picky person. If this even remotely had a good flavor I would have been fine with it. But everyone who tried it agreed that it made the popcorn taste worse and not better and added almost no flavor at all. I wish I could have tasted the product before I purchased it. So, I guess I am out about $25."
79689,B0061UQBSS,4.0,"This is a VERY strong roast and a great morning coffee if you need your eyeballs popped open in a hurry!  I would strongly suggest using the largest cup size when brewing this kcup.  I used quite a bit of sweetener and threw in some cocoa powder which really enhanced the flavor and actually made the coffee much smoother.  Next time, I will use even more milk to further dilute the flavor.  This coffee would be a great base for cappucino, frappucino, etc etc.  I picked this up at Bed/Bath/Beyond for $11.99 with 20% off coupon.  It's also available at Target and Safeway."
130965,B002Q7TQVY,1.0,"I received a sampler gift pack of Bentley's tea and loved the jasmine tea that came in the gift set. However, when I ordered the larger quantity of Jasmine tea from them, it has a much different taste and is not the same quality as the tea included in the gift set. I was very disappointed in this tea. Not good quality jasmine, not true jasmine flavor. Frustrating now that I am stuck with 6 tins of this poor tasting tea. I never noticed the non-return policy even though 5 of the 6 tins are still sealed - don't make the same mistake I did!"
137670,B000CQE3HS,1.0,In May of 2010 I ordered a box of Slim Jims original flavor 100 count .28 oz.<br />I opened one up and took a bite expecting a really tasty snack but as hard as I tried I just couldn't chew it.<br />It was like shoe leather. After 2 minutes of chewing I spit it out. I packed up the box and sent it back.<br />Amazon was kind enough to refund my money.<br />Next time order the Jacks Links Original .5 oz X Sticks and you can't go wrong.<br />Chuck.<br />PS: Thanks to Amazon for there customer care.
17853,B0086B4WUO,5.0,"Zapps potato chips are absolutely delicious.  Every flavor is marvelous; we buy them at the grocery store and order the multi-flavor packs online.  Voodoo is our family favorite; it has a perfect amount of Cajun zing but is not hot, just very flavorful.  A bag has never lasted more than one meal at our house - it is constantly being passed and devoured.  The lucky winner is the one who steals the seasoning from the bag liner at the bottom of the feast!  After finding Zapps, we eat no other type of potato chip.  Certainly everyone has his own opinion but for us, Zapps Voodoo is as good as it can get.  Bon Appetit and Laissez Les Bontemps Rouler!"

77585,B001LG940E,4.0,"Really, is the generic black cherry soda you can get at the grocery store actually SUPPOSED to taste like cherry, in any way?  I think not.  The Switch offers up an entirely new flavor, one that actually tastes like . . . cherries!  Amazing, I know.  This soda didn't have the sickeningly sweet flavor that most cherry sodas do.  This has probably been my least favorite of The Switch's flavors that I have tried -- I even liked the orange one better!  The flavor wasn't overpowering and goes down easy enough, it just didn't particularly like it all the much.  I do like The Switch products, though, and appreciate that there are no added sweeteners or any of that other junk you find in so many beverages these days.  And as I had mentioned in another review, their products are difficult to find in stores so it is great that Amazon is now carrying them."
124800,B003TIVBSK,1.0,"I bought the variety pack of this brand chip with lime, black bean, and plain. They had to be the most greasy weird gummy tasting chip I have ever had in my entire life!  I am not that picky but these were so strangely bad that I am surprised anyone gave these a good review. Yikes...it all went into the garbage after several attempts to like these. The lime flavor was the least gummy, but why bother?  I will stick to ""Garden of Eatin"" brand from now on."

As a newly diagnosed Celiac sufferer, I was feeling depressed and starving! This has to be the best brownie I have ever tasted. I did add pecans to it. It is so good with gluten free moose tracks ice cream on top!!! My husband says these are better than regular brownies. When I discovered I could order bulk on Amazon, I was estatic. If you have Celiac or if you just want a great brownie you should try these."
80642,B001NH07M0,4.0,"I tried this after trying (and loving) the Tea's Etc Organic Coconut-Almond add-on.  This is a very good tea. It's a little mild for my tastes, as I was expecting the tea and ginger to have bolder flavors. (I'm not astute enough about tea to know if this is a blend issue or a freshness issue. Given the strong aroma I suspect the former.) That said, I really do enjoy it and just find myself using a pinch more and letting it seep longer to achieved the desired outcome. The aroma is wonderful and I think this is a perfect afternoon tea. (Who doesn't feel more energized after getting a whiff of citrus?!). The fact that the flavor isn't overpowering also makes it a good choice for folks who want to ease into drinking green tea. I'll order this again, but it will be awhile.  These ""small"" 3-oz packages last an impressively long time even with daily consumption!<br /><br />Update 9//11/12:  I paid $8.62 for this item.  I see it's now selling for less than $2..."

160914,B001EQ5LLC,3.0,"It tastes like what Herrings should taste like.  I like the fact that it's not packed in oil, so I can actually mix the liquid into my breakfast oatmeal.  It doesn't have a strong fish smell, and should not annoy people sensitive to fish.  I was expecting a bit firmer flesh, but I guess Roland smoke their herrings thoroughly so the meat is a bit mushy.  But again, it's very tasty.<br /><br />BTW, since the herrings are fatty, if you save unfinished fish in the can inside the fridge, there will be a film of fish oil on top when you open it.  I usually place the whole can inside a toaster oven and heat it up for a few minutes to get the oil back to liquid form.  I actually like the taste better when it's warm."

I can't believe that people would mix this with a smoothie. I mix 3 tablespoons with about 3oz of water and down it while holding my breath and immediately chase it with something like orange juice.  Does it work?  I have no idea.  Tough to tell.  I'll give it another month and see.  The price is right though, to at least try it out. I won't buy another bag of this foul powder though, I'll try the pills...."
82689,B005UP1M4I,4.0,"This product is pretty easy to use, I'd say you can make 10 pods at home in about 10 minutes.  Obviously this takes a little bit of time, you'll need to grind your own bean, fill the pods, undo the adhesive and stick on the foil.  It's really quite easy, it doesn't take any real coordination, and it is even a little bit fun. I would think most people would not care to put in the effort to use this product, but if you get a kick out of getting a better price for something and like working with your hands, this is a nice alternative.  You wont get rich off your savings, and there is a considerable amount of time and effort to make use of these, but it's not nearly as hard as some reviewers say, and the success ratio of each pod is very good.  Once you get the hang of it, you can make pods pretty quickly. Try it if you think it's for you, it does work and tastes great!"

236079,B005FTVWYE,2.0,"When I opened up the box, I was greeted with the smell of horseradish, not exactly what I wanted after purchasing sealed containers. I do not like the flavor of this horseradish. I've opened 2 of the 4, and both tasted overly salty and hot, but with very little horseradish flavor. I enjoy hot horseradish, but not when it comes at the expense of flavor. It ruined a batch of horseradish mustard I made at home.<br /><br />I'm going to stick with Helluva Good horseradish from now on. It's not very hot, but the flavor is there."
78361,B00064VQO4,4.0,"First of all, this item came well packaged in eco friendly packing peanuts. Run them in a bit of water and they disintegrate into nothing!

I love a good oil but I am no expert in oils. I think this one tastes smooth and peppery, not heavy. I will use this oil for dishes where I don't need it heated, and I will use my cheaper stuff on the stove.<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 17, 2012 - Good stuff, esp on a salad with a good balsamic vinegar. I would give it 5 stars if my palate were more refined and had experienced more EVOO's out there."
162947,B005P6TCGW,3.0,"Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now.  Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax.  Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon."
237189,B000EDM772,2.0,I bought this because I am on a low carb diet and was craving BREAD!  I used to bake bread in our bread maker all the time and thought this would satisfy the craving. It kinda did but I don't think it's worth the price.  I found a bread at the grocery store that has the same number of carbs as this and tastes better and is way cheaper.
79995,B000GPW55M,4.0,My favorite lifesaver! I like buying them in the large bag because the lifesavers are 30 percent bigger. And I stash these everywhere at work and home and in the car. Great for freshening your breath our just having something to suck on.
126979,B0015Q94NM,1.0,"With disparity between the Dollar and the Euro, the price of this cereal has been rising where a lot of groceries have simply dropped it.  I was glad to find it on Amazon; actually it was pointed out to me via an e-mail to Switzerland.<br />I have been eating this cereal for over 20 years on a daily basis.  They have changed the formulation over the years a little [more oats initially]but it still the closest to true Swiss Muesli since I was introduced to it in the 1950's.<br />Only one local store comes close in price but they do not always have it.<br />***They ran out of this on Amazon and through one of their vendor it is now $72 per carton with shipping!  That's $12 a carton!  You can get it typically for under $9 in the store.  I tried a carton of the Original (Orange) formula.  Still the old price.  But it is very sweet.***"
16748,B001LGGH40,5.0,"Of the four flavors this product comes in, this is my fav. It is light, fruity, and refreshing. There is no weird taste, no bitterness. I'm willing to give up the 100 plus calories this has per serving to get 100% of the RDA of vitamin C and feel really refreshed. I think this product is so good because there is no sticky sweetness, no heaviness like regular juice has. The carbonation and the proportion of the various juices fits my palate perfectly. I would love a larger serving, but the calories would get out of hand. I may never go back to straight juice again."
127495,B005VOONKI,1.0,"Sooooo disappointing. The coffee smells great but what emerges from the coffeemaker is what my mother used to refer to as ""dishwater."" In fact, that's actually kind. I added cream, as usual, and the liquid turned almost white. This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for ""this side down"" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew. For now, save your money. This stuff makes Dunkin's regular taste like a gourmet blend."
77773,B001LG940E,4.0,"My family and I spent 12 years in another country where cherry juice was readily available and very much enjoyed! I ordered this in hopes that this would satisfy our desire for that delicious taste. I found some things I like and some things I don't like about this product.<br /><br />First, things I like:<br />This product is 100% juice and has a taste that reminds me of the cherry juice we used to enjoy overseas.<br />It is a potential substitute for soft drinks.<br /><br />Now the things I don't like:<br />Fruit juice--at least this fruit juice--is too sweet to quench one's thirst. Perhaps if it was diluted with Seltzer water, it would do the trick. If you give this to kids, limit quantity and give them a drink of water afterwards so they don't get thirstier and thirstier as they drink.<br />While this is 100% juice, it isn't all cherry juice. The first ingredient is apple juice, the second grape juice, the third is cherry juice. Makes me wonder if the ""natural flavors"" on the ingredient list are to try to boost the cherry taste.<br />It's expensive--nearly a dollar for an 8 oz. can. At that price, I wouldn't keep this around to drink any old time.<br /><br />So there you have it.  I wouldn't buy this on a regular basis, but if money is no object, you might want to give this a try and see what you think."
164432,B001FA1HYW,3.0,"The milk chocolate chunks in this product are heavenly.  The reason for the 3-star rating, whereas my other reviews of the Al Wadi halvas are higher, is primarily because of the inconsistency in the quality of the product from tub to tub in the same case, in the same shipment.  The first one I opened was amazing.  There were enormous globs of those wonderful chocolate chunks and the halva was soft, and resembled chocolate chip cookie dough in texture with this sweet, nutty taste that was to-die-for.  The next tub I opened was quite dry and although it had some good chunks in it, I found that I was basically digging out the chocolate and avoiding the halva, which was hard, dry and nearly tasteless.  The remaining tubs followed this trend.  I compared the halva in this product (just the halva) to the plain Al Wadi halva and it didn't taste nearly as good; it was also harder and drier and more compacted.  If I were rating on the halva alone in this particular iteration, I would have to give it 1 or 2 stars, but the stellar chocolate pieces really deserve some credit, so I settled on an overall rating of 3 stars.  I don't think that this type has as much benefit for breastfeeding mothers as the plain or pistachio types because of the large amount of chocolate which has been introduced to the product, and the benefit comes in the halawa extract which is in the halva and not the chocolate.  If you're looking to increase your breast milk production, get the plain or pistachio; however, I think the American palette would be more receptive to this, the halva with chocolate, IMHO.  Get some gas relief pills if you're going to be snacking on halva constantly for breast milk production (take it from me and save yourself the pain)!"

You can do this but it's more trouble than it's worth impo.  This would probably be great in cookie recipes as the lack of oil wouldn't interfere with the consistency of the batter.<br /><br />Overall this is a great product that delivers as promised.<br /><br />>>P.S - Resist the urge to eat a spoonful of this stuff plain.

77809,B001LG940E,4.0,"The Switch Black Cherry soda has a light, fruity taste and less fizz than a regular soft drink. It's a pretty color -- sort of  a deep maroon.  It would make a nice addition to a fruit punch which you might mix for a party.  I put the can into the refrigerator overnight and then poured it into a glass with no ice.<br /><br /> I enjoyed it very much, although I must say that the black cherry flavor is not really dominant.  It tastes fruity, and it has no chemical taste like some fruit-flavored soft drinks.  Overall, I think it tastes better than  Juicy Juice, which it kind of reminded me of.  Actually, ""black cherry juice"" is the third ingredient listed -- apple and grape juices are listed first.<br /><br />I like the can size (which is less beverage than a regular 12-ounce soda) because I constantly find myself opening a Coke and then not finishing (and thus wasting) the remaining soda.  So this 8.3 ounce size is perfect for my taste.<br /><br />Switch soda is advertised as being more healthful because it has no added sugar, but that's not quite the case if you read the product's ingredient list.  The juice used has sugar, it's just not artificially sugared, and it has no artificial colors.  So it's all juice, but those juices have sugar.  It's more healthful than a regular soda, though, since it's all-natural.<br /><br />Switch is a little pricy.  I buy it for a special treat for myself or my daughters since it is something different from the regular soft drinks, and it has doesn't contain artificial ingredients.  We also like the Tangerine/Orange flavor, but are not crazy about the Grape."
82291,B0060JMVM0,4.0,The EVOO is as tasty as described in other reviews. I thought I'd comment on the container. It is hard to open at best. The green pouring spout is accessed by pulling a ring pull which is very hard to pry up. Then it takes considerable pulling to expand the pour spout. The cap then unscrews however it is very hard to pour without a large amount of residue accumulating on the top of the container.<br />I recommend the oil but also recomment decanting it into another container or pouring bottle.

I will post a picture if I can figure out how. There were pieces of stems beyond the bud.  Piece of leaves of the were clearly not baby buds but of mature leaves.  Lots of brown colors there were pieces of leaves that were clearly not beautiful fuzzy little friends.  The buds that were there were more yellow than the delicate green.<br /><br />brew:  there was lots of debris/particulate in the first few brews.  the brew lacked delicate aroma and its color was off darker than I'm used to.  the flavor was more earthy than delicate reminding me of a strong cheap green tea. this tea also lacked exquisite sweat flavors/aromas that I so love about silver needle teas.<br /><br />on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this tea and 1.5 or 2.

79743,B0025UCI94,4.0,"Bread in a can?  Sounds positively revolting right?  Not so fast.  The  Burnham & Morrill Co. of Portland, Maine has been in the canning business for more than a century now.  These are the folks who bring you that staple of millions of American households--B & M Original Baked Beans.  But the folks at B & M also produce a companion product of old New England-B&M Brown Bread.  This is an item that most Americans have probably never sampled or for that matter ever even heard of.  When you pop open a can of  B & M Brown Bread (which is steam cooked right in the can!) I will be the first to admit that it does not appear to be particularly appetizing.  But looks are deceiving.  B & M Brown Bread has been a popular item around these parts for generations.<br /><br />For lots of New England families the tradition of  having baked beans and brown bread for supper on Saturday continues to this day.  Many of us grew up with beans and franks and brown bread on Saturday nights.  This is just the kind of  rib-sticking, intensely flavored food that we crave around here, particularly on a cold, blustery night.  Legend has it that brown bread is closely related to an earlier bread known as ""rye and Indian"" (from ""Indian"" cornmeal) or ""thirded"" bread from its use of rye, cornmeal, and wheat flours.  Now you might surmise that bread that is actually cooked in a can would be full of preservatives. This is simply not the case.  Despite its downright creepy appearance  B&M canned bread is actually about as natural as anything out there.  The ingredients listed on the can include water, whole wheat flour, molasses, dextrose, rye flour, whey, corn meal, baking soda, buttermilk, salt and corn oil.  Compare that to all of the junk found in your favorite snack food!  What's more, B & M Brown Bread tastes great!  B & M Brown Bread comes in two delicious varieties--Original and with Raisin.  I love them both but am partial to the raisin.  Brown bread is not something I purchase very often these days but when I do it is a real treat.  Just heat and serve!  B & M Brown Bread is great just as is or with some butter and really is the perfect accompaniment to a franks and beans or ham and bean supper.  Try it sometime!<br /><br />Now I am not really sure if you can even find B & M Brown Bread everywhere in the country.  It's great to see that it is available through Amazon.  Around here it sells for about $2.00 a can.  What prompted me to write this review is that I saw this product advertised in a catalogue for $8.50.  Such a deal!  The catalogue describes the taste of B & M Brown Bread this way;  ""Extremely moist and dense, this New England treat is made using only natural ingredients and has a rich molasses taste that comes through with every bite"".  I would concur.  So go ahead.  Be brave.  For a taste sensation just a tad bit out of the ordinary I recommend that you give this all-time New England favorite a try.  Highly recommended!"

166590,B002AMXQNY,3.0,"When my husband and I tried the Dolce Gusto mocha for the first time, we were surprised that it tasted more like hot chocolate than coffee.  Further inspection of the box (and confirmed by opening a used capsule) revealed that unlike the other DG flavors (with or without milk) which have real coffee grounds, the mocha coffee capsule contains soluble instant coffee instead.<br /><br />It's not bad if you like a caffeinated hot chocolate, but by the name ""mocha"" I was expecting a proper latte with a little cocoa added, so I was rather dissapointed.  Wish the description had mentioned about the instant coffee - neither Amazon (at the time of my order and this review) nor the DG website says that.  I love my DG machine and crave a cappuccino more than once a day, but this mocha is not a flavor that I would come back to regularly.  On occassion though (since I have 3 boxes of this stuff!) I'd use this to make more of a cafe Viennois by adding whipped cream to it..."
16743,B001LGGH40,5.0,Nice and sweet. Tastes like strawberry and kiwi. All natural ingredients.<br /><br />I recommend The Switch!
77756,B001LG940E,4.0,"First, this is a household that VERY rarely drinks soda of any type due to health concerns and a deliberate decision to eradicate soda from our diets. Having said that, there are times when you really would like a soda. The Switch soda seems to fit the bill as a soda alternative...no sugar, no preservatives and no artificial sweeters - just carbonated fruit juice. So far so good. The taste is pretty good and quite comprable to ""unhealthy"" sodas - to the point that my other half didn't think it was healthy at all...he liked the flavor very well.<br /><br />The only reason ths didn't get a full five stars is the size is relatively small...something I personally didn't mind because I actually like the size and shape a LOT but spouse didn't...he felt it was just far too small...and the price. AT roughly $1 per can, this is considerably higher priced than a regular soda - however, in keeping with other healthy alternatives.<br /><br />Pro's -<br />Good taste (can't tell this is healthy) that isn't ""over the top""<br />Nice level of carbonation - just right<br />Healthy alternative to a standard soda<br /><br />Con's -<br />Price<br /><br />Debates -<br />Size - 1 liked size other didn't like size (wanted larger size)<br /><br />Bottom line...<br />I would probably purchase this if the price was lower but being a non-soda drinker would be unlikely to add this to my shopping list at this price. I probably would buy it via a vending machine when out and about and wanting an alternative to plain bottled water or soda (which I dont drink)."

17896,B001EO653M,5.0,Love this stuff.  It has one of the best combinations of chocolate and mexican spice flavors of any I have tried.  I used to live near a bookstore where the cafe made mochas with this cocoa and now I buy it at home for the same purpose.  It also works really well to add a little spice to your cookies.

240587,B004JQTD3G,2.0,"This dry coffee ground stenches of turpentine and vodka, the bag itself smelling of dogfood before it's opened.  The bag sent to me might just be aromatically individuated, but if so it's a stinky individual.  Once brewed, the coffee functions as coffee does and seems low acid for its effect on my stomach.  The pleasant effect of the low acidity might be worth the initial stench; no belly cramps nor aches occur after drinking it.  The horse flies and God Himself stay away from the grounds though, on the basis of its infernal reek.<br /><br />If you don't care how pernicious a stench the coffee grounds have before the coffee's made, this is a fine product indeed -- and it's low acid content, so it is easier on your belly."

153347,B000E46LYQ,3.0,"In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt.<br /><br />So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted.<br /><br />Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand.

124838,B005EF0HRM,1.0,"Quite literally, I have never seen anything like this gift basket construction from Back Mountain Baskets represented here by the igourmet label. And unfortunately, I don't mean that in a positive way. As someone who frequently purchases gift baskets (I average four to six a year and at one time procured hundreds as corporate gifts), I was extremely dissatisfied with this item. When you purchase a gift basket, two things are relatively certain: 1) you're going to overpay for what's actually included, and (2) at least you're going to get something presentable and of gift quality. Heck, these are even advertised as gourmet items!  Only a couple of items might actually qualify as exotic or gourmet.  At a $49.99 list price, there is maybe $20 worth of small snacks, most of which could be replicated at your local convenience store. If I had made a gift basket at home, it would have been classier and more tasteful than the horribly amateurish efforts made by this company.<br /><br />I won't even discuss the quality of the items included in the basket which I actually have some serious reservations about. This basket is NOT something that you would (or should) pay to have a professional company assemble due to packaging. Many of the included items are stuffed into boxes and wrapped rather cheaply with handmade labels. Okay, not a very deluxe or fancy presentation. But what's worse (and frankly unforgivable) is that the boxes used are not plain white gift boxes or something else presentable--no, they are emptied trash from other products re-purposed.<br /><br />Do you want your elegant food items (again I'm being generous with the item quality) in old cracker boxes glued back together? Just whose recycling bin have they been raiding? It's rather distasteful. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about--first is the empty box used and in parenthesis is the actual item inside:<br /><br />Keebler Club Cracker Box (pretzels)<br />Stauffer's Animal Cracker Box (other cookies)<br />Crystal Light Fruit Punch Box (candies)<br />Nabisco Wheat Thins Box (popcorn)<br />Jello Gelatin Box (cookies)<br /><br />These are but a few examples of boxes used to repackage other items. I got two of these baskets and they were both constructed in a similar manner. Seriously. If you paid to have an elegant gift basket, would you expect to find loose candies glued into a Crystal Light box? As I said, there isn't even the common sense and taste level to use plain white boxes. It would be an embarrassment to send this as a gift item. Due to the packaging, I even threw a number of items straight into the trash as I was not confident of their handling due to the obvious lack of professional standards. A huge disappointment and very unappetizing all around. KGHarris, 10/11."
161710,B000K6Z22U,3.0,"Not as good as Le Saunier De Camargue Fleur De Sel. I did a side by side taste comparison and it isn't as good as the aforementioned. It has too much moisture, the flakes are bigger, and the flavor was not as good."
249749,B001LGGH54,2.0,"The flavor name of this ""The Switch"" drink is ""Watermelon Strawberry.""  I thought there was a law in what you put for the beginning names of a flavor -- it is supposed to be the main ingredient by weight.  For example in a soup named Beef Vegetable the ingredient of Beef must be listed as one of the first ingredients in the soup, not ""potatoes, carrots, etc.""  In this case the first ingredients are ""100% juice"" reconstituted with ""filtered sparkling water"" of the following juice concentrates: ""Grape, Apple, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon.""  Note that Watermelon and Strawberry are listed last and next to last among the fruit juice concentrates.<br /><br />I think the drink tastes too strong and the carbonation is too strong.  Even after adding ice AND letting it become diluted, the flavor is too strong.  Now that would be a good thing if I liked the flavor but I do not.  I have tried one other flavor, the Kiwi Berry and it is also like this as well -- too strong.<br /><br />AND like I said on the other review, I think it would make a good base for an ice cream punch bowl drink. A lot of vanilla ice cream would help. Would not buy it for a regular thirst quenching drink.<br /><br />140 calories for 8.3 oz. including 36 carbs (35g. sugar), 15mg. sodium, 100% daily allowance of Vitamin C."

I bought the chocolate dip, honey mustard dressing, pancake syrup and barbecue sauce. All of them were so gross! On the label of all of their products it says, zero carbs zero calories, zero fat. How is that possible? These items are no more than LOTS of thickening agents like, xanthan gum, guar gum, and acacia gum and flavorings. The thing I didn't like about them was that they tasted fake, and they had the consistency of snot. Seriously. I was not that desperate so I threw them all away. If you are looking for a low carb version of jams and syrups, try Nature's Hollow. They make the same thing with Xylitol and it tastes a LOT better than that nasty Splenda."

I read reviews and although some hated this product I figured I had nothing to lose. I ordered it and I was happy with the results. I did not have to constantly go over the eyes or whiskers to make it darker (had to do that with the wilton brand). I used one pen and it seemed like it didn't want to work after the first few cake pops. No worries, just popped the second one open and from then on it was smooth sailing.

Gotta love it!<br /><br />However, the Matiz Gallego Sardines in Olive Oil look better and taste way fresher, although the cans are made of heavier metal and are far harder to open than any other sardines I've tried.

With that said, they worked out just fine for making PB&J and my son had no complaints about the taste.

You want to take the brownies from this mix from ""good"" into the stratosphere of ""awesomeness""?  Here's my tip, stolen from the Paula Deen website.  Mix up the brownie mix.  Pour half into a baking pan.  Chop up a toffee bar (the supersize symphony bar works well) and spread over the bottom half of the batter.  If you're feeling like a super-delicious extra-heavy brownie, just lay down the whole bar and get another half of a second bar to make a complete layer.  Then pour in the other half of the batter and bake according to the directions.  You will soon be eating the best from-a-mix brownie you've ever eaten, gluten-free or otherwise."

Does not come in glass jar, organic comes in glass jar.<br /><br />This Honey deserves ***** 5 stars but the seller zero for misrepresentation. YS Farms raw honey is a very good raw honey, very good tasting and I have consumed many jars of the YS Farm raw honey but this is not an organic raw honey, it is conventional regardless how good it tastes. It is good enough that I just ordered few jars of this from Vitamin Shoppe since they were selling it for $5.91 a jar. I consume the organic one as well. The labeling on the jar is specified as Y.S. ECO BEE FARMS. There is no misrepresentation by the YS, it is by the sellers including Amazon where they specify as organic just to boost their sells but then after busted they close that chapter or correct the disclaimer. Apparently Monsanto recently contributed $4.2 million to defeat the ballot measure scheduled for California voters on November 6, 2012, proposition 37, along with DuPont, Bayer, BASF, Syngenta, and other biotech companies that have each contributed over a million dollars each in their attempt to keep us the consumer in the dark about GMOs in our food. YS Farms sells 100% organic honey with certification and USDA stamp for more money. Consumers like LIZABETH have chosen to make misleading comments. For LIZABETH to discredit USDA, organic certification process, as well as YS Farms when YS Farms sells the organic honey, and then define a non organic honey as ""some of the best organic raw honey out there"" is appalling. Hopefully consumers will get the chance to read the facts and educate themselves accordingly and organic farmers will keep producing organic produce for individuals who actually want organic instead of conventional, regardless of LIZABETH's misleading comments and explanations.<br /><br />Some of the best organic raw honey out there!, April 22, 2012<br />By Lizabeth (BARTLESVILLE, OK, United States)<br />Our very favorite raw honey comes from All About Bees in Ralston, NE but this honey is a very, very close second. I resorted to bringing in honey from afar when I no longer had access to our favorite. I wanted to buy honey locally and everybody says theirs is ""raw"" but it isn't unless it is cloudy and a bit gritty like this one is (those are good qualities, I promise!). My kids quickly came to enjoy this texture and taste as their favorite. The clear stuff is too cloyingly sweet. Anyway, I will be using this as the honey for my family and the 3 pound size here on Amazon with Prime is a great deal when they can keep it in stock!<br /><br />Sep 4, 2012 6:09:55 PM PDT Lizabeth says:<br />I appreciate you notifying me of your concerns. However, until they can put a leash on bees, I don't trust ANY organic labeling for honey! My review is based on reputation, taste, and comparison to my favorite raw honey in addition to many, many years of raw honey consumption. Organically certified honey from Canada from purportedly pesticide free regions tastes exactly the same to me - I have purchased them both and based my recommendation on my personal opinion and rated it accordingly.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT SOME OF THE BEST RAW HONEY OUT THERE SINCE IT IS A CONVENTIONAL HONEY NOT AN ORGANIC HONEY, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BEST CONVENTIONAL RAW HONEY OUT THERE. SHAME ON CONSUMERS AND SELLERS WHO MISREPRESENT AND MISGUIDE PUBLIC FOR THEIR OWN SELFISH AND FINANCIAL GAIN.<br /><br />I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa in my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best low calorie energy I can get to boost my immune system and give me healthy energy when I am middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutrition when heated but any further heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollens in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon. This is a superfood to me only when it is from quality producers, in a raw stage, and not mixing it with hot drinks in moderation. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. Bravo."
82719,B0055Z8ROQ,4.0,"These broccoli seeds sprout fine, though the sprouts seem to grow slower/smaller than the more expensive broccoli seeds I've bought through SproutPeople. I usually grow the sprouts for 72-84 hours. With 4 tablespoons of SproutPeople seeds, 3 or 3.5 days's growth will fill about 3/4 of my EasySprout container. With Sprout House seeds, the sprouts fill up only about 50% of the container. Just about all the seeds sprouted, though."

Found a bunch of flavors here, figured I'd try the Fuji as they seemed to be the best value.  Quite yummy, even w/o the cinnamon.  Pieces do seem smaller than I remember, but that does not affect the flavor.  Biggest problem seems to be similar to regular chips:  eating too many!  :-)"

160516,B001E5DZV6,3.0,"This product is a VERY light roast.  I suppose my not being such a huge fan of this product is due to my own poor research prior to ordering, but I doubt I'll purchase this item again.  The coffee is *ok* but definitely nothing I'm doing backflips over.  The body is far lighter than I would've anticipated or desired.  The aroma isn't bad, though I can't say it seems as fresh as would be desired, either.  All together I'd say this was decidely mediocre.<br /><br />I should also include, though, that I use a Keurig coffee maker, with one of the refill-able baskets (I love the k-cup varieties, but they get to be too expensive for every day use, when you consume as much coffee as I do).  Perhaps this would be a more enjoyable blend if used in a traditional coffee pot, where you have the ability to overload the filter with grounds.  That being said, clearly this is not the coffee for me."
157960,B004KTDUFY,3.0,"While the wasabi flavor of these peas was strong, and they were hot and sweet both at the same time, the peas were super hard, many were so dry they just disintegrated when they were bitten into. Also, the majority of the peas were not whole--they were broken pieces, half of a pea, chunks of dried peas, but not whole, round, pretty peas. I realize wasabi peas are dried--I love wasabi peas and I eat them all the time--but these were super hard and super dry, like dusty inside when bitten into.<br /><br />Also, no nutritional label or ingredients information was provided with the peas... and the packaging was ordinary, normal plastic bags, with no information, labels, printing, anything on them to say what they were. I would imagine the bags are filled from larger bulk bags, but some sort of ingredients or nutritional labeling should have come with the product.<br /><br />So while the flavor was good, the texture and the size and the consistency of the product was poor. They were okay, and I did eat them, but I honestly probably wouldn't order them again from this seller. I've ordered others from Amazon.com sellers that were much better, and I would likely go back to them before ordering from here again."
79532,B003TNANSO,4.0,"Taste is a personal issue so I won't comment on that.  Just be advised that compared to the Fruit and Nut variety which, if you hold one sideways, will actually slowly fold over, these are thicker and MUCH more solid.

167808,B00176G24O,3.0,"This product had a picture of a full case when I made my purchase. It states that the original price is $58.19. That must be a typo. I ordered 2, they came very quickly (about 3 days). When you order, it is for a single and they are about the size of a small fist. My dogs did like them, however they have been at it for about 15 minutes and they are already half gone. So they don't last too long. With the price you pay for shipping I don't think this product is worth it. I have gotten treats by this brand before though and my dogs really liked them."

She just holds them in her mouth or sets them down. I broke one in half to see if the size was the problem, but she still did not eat it.<br /><br />I did not try these myself, but I'm going to say that my household consensus is that these are not a favorite."
249827,B001E5DRCS,2.0,These nuts were a disappointment.  Not near as good as the reviews that I had read.  The nuts taste stale to me and were not very tasty.  I normally purchase my nuts from another source and I have found them to be fresher and with more flavor.

240575,B00113ZZ5U,2.0,"I started adding coconut of all different forms to my diet since learning of its health benefits, particularly as a rare source of medium-chain triglycerides and its resistance to oxidation from the heat of cooking. I also thoroughly enjoy the sweet, nutty flavor of coconut. I not only cook with coconut oil, but I add it to foods for its theoretical health benefits as well. For variety, I sometimes will use coconut butter instead. So, when I came across these 7-ounce packets of creamed coconut, and at a lower per-ounce cost, I was expecting to be pleased. Unfortunately, I must say that I dislike this product. First, the health benefits of coconut are found mostly in its oil, so the added coconut meat in this product offers very little nutritionally over the oil. Second, the coconut meat of this product makes it too sandy, producing an unpleasant mouth feel for me. Third and worst of all, this stuff requires too much effort to use. Pouring  the soft, oily product from the plastic pouches is messy. Even worse, when cooled and solidified, it becomes rock-hard. Melting it is just not worth the effort. I'll stick with coconut oil or coconut butter."

132727,B001SAQG18,1.0,I was happy to see another grocery store option for Stevia that seemed to be price a bit lower.

It may be my taste buds but I think it is a big rip off. - Dot

160525,B000ILK9QG,3.0,"I thought this was good, but I have to agree with the people who said that the sodium content could be lowered.  The label is misleading, as it tells you to put a cap full of seasoning on your popcorn.  The nutritional info is for a 1/4 teaspoon of seasoning, which has a rather high amount of sodium.  A cap full is at least 2 tablespoons of seasoning."

249506,B001LGGH54,2.0,"My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase, Watermelon Strawberry is somewhat more desirable than Kiwi Berry.  For a beverage that claims to have no added sugar, Watermelon Strawberry Switch very sweet -- almost too sweet for me.  It reminded us of strawberry sparkling cider, though Switch's ""fizz"" content is somewhat less.  I thought the strawberry taste overwhelmed the watermelon taste, but my brother had an opposite reaction -- he said it tasted like a watermelon Jolly Rancher candy. ""Too much like liquid candy"" was his sum-up, and the rest of us agreed.  Good for a sweet treat, but not for an everyday beverage -- unless you've got a major sweet tooth.  There are tastier ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix."
167628,B006BXUZVO,3.0,"Cinnamon Almond Raisin Bran adds...cinnamon and almonds to your Raisin Bran. Plenty of people on here think it tastes amazing, so I'm a bit in the minority. I think it tastes...okay. It's a bit too sweet for me and a little too strong on the cinnamon. If you want a good analogy of what it tastes like, this cereal basically tastes like you're eating a bowlful of candied almonds. It's been a couple years since I've eaten regular Raising Bran so maybe things have changed or maybe it's just this cereal but I always remember the raisins in Raising Bran being a bit on the small side and kind of firm; in my box of Cinnamon Almond Raising Bran anyway the raisins are fairly large and are soft, making for a bit of squishiness. This is a pretty good cereal that kids and people with a sweet-tooth will probably love. It really does taste just like you're eating candied almonds. Worth trying if you like cinnamon, almonds, and Raisin Bran on their own."

No Okra at all, and only one small piece of sausage and a few strands of meat of any kind. I don't know if that's what it takes to make it healthier (cheaper to produce). It probably wouldn't be too bad if you added more rice (small amount compared to New Orleans version I had) and your own sausage pieces, okra and misc. vegetables. It isn't bad tasting just disappointing ""presentation"" vs. what you receive. It is a base basically not a stew or soup."

Making it to the manufacturer's specifications, I mixed in 1 1/3 tablespoons (that's 4 teaspoons)to 6-8 ounces of water.  The foamy top layer looked good, just like a restaurant latte.  But, the proof is in the aroma (light pumpkin spice scent) and the drinking.  I did not taste the coffee at all.  In fact, it was more of a tea-like flavor.  Too weak.<br /><br />Reading the ingredients list is a sojourn into a science class.  To paraphrase an old TV commercial, it's 'better living through chemistry'.

131432,B000YDRP2Y,1.0,"For all the hype these Leonard Mountain dry soups have gotten, they sure did disappoint. I have made 6 varieties now (sitting here with a bowl of the Chicken Pasta as I type), and they were consistently bad...even though I followed the package directions EXACTLY. Maybe that was the problem - I followed the package directions. None were done in 20 minutes. (""edible"" in 20 minutes - yes; worth paying xx dollars for it - no; worth calling it ""gourmet"" - no.) And one reviewer called the veggies ""chunky"" - really? Wonder what kind of soup they're used to if they think these soups are chunky.<br /><br />My advice: Lipton instant soup will give you just about the same salty, overseasoned experience as these Leonard Mountain mixes, but for a lot cheaper. Of course, Liption instant soup doesn't purport to call itself ""gourmet"" like LM does.<br /><br />My real advice: Want a ""real"" soup that REALLY only takes 20 minutes? Throw some stock (canned broth will work too) in a pot and let it boil, then toss in some fresh veggies (frozen if you want), pre-cooked meat (or raw shrimp), pasta if you want it, canned beans if you want them, and cook until the veggies are the way you like them. Season to taste with just salt and pepper, or add garlic and/or onion powder. Green herbs are great too if you know how to use them.<br /><br />If you're using a crockpot (which I do all the time), do the same thing except wait until the last 30 minutes to toss in the pre-cooked meat. You could also get away with dried beans in a crockpot.<br /><br />In any case, fresh soup only takes 20 minutes to begin with, so these LM soups aren't saving anyone any time.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy these again. EVER. If I need convenience, I'd rather buy canned soup than these."

17607,B000CMIYWC,5.0,"My husband recently stopped smoking (yay!) and this tea has really helped him clear all that junk out of his chest.  It has a pleasant taste and aroma, being neither too strong or too weak, and we both find ourselves drinking it simply for the flavor. This tea is great to drink during and after having any type of chest cold.  Good way to get fluids and soothe a cough related to illness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea products are the very best out there and buying them here at Amazon is way cheaper than buying them in a store ($4-$6 per box.)

148651,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"I recently got a chance to try the new(ish) Planters Big Nut Bars from Kraft Foods and I have to say that they're pretty darn good.  If you're into granola bars, these will be a little bit of a departure as you really don't get that kind of consistency.  These are also nuttier, and overall seem to be more akin to a nut-based candy bar like a Payday.<br /><br />As far as the pluses go, the bars have a nice balance of sweet and salty, and though the consistency doesn't scream granola bar, it's just chewy enough that it also doesn't scream peanut bar (like the various brands of peanut brittle-esqe bars you tend to find in vending machines.)  The peanut butter coating on the bottom also has a nice consistency and taste, not chalky or too sweet like peanut butter tends to get in products like this.  Also, at 46 grams, it's pretty satisfying, and I'd think it would certainly make for a decent small meal on the go if you're in a pinch.<br /><br />There are some drawbacks though.  Mainly the bars can get a little messy where the peanut butter is concerned, so I can imagine it would be a nightmare with kids.  The bars are also pretty high in fat, which isn't as much surprising (they are peanut based), as it is unfortunate.  At 13g of fat per bar (3g saturated), these really are in the category of meal replacement, and not snacks.  If you're looking for a healthy snack I'd stick with a more basic granola bar."

It is so bad that this is the first PB that I have purchased in awhile because as soon as I buy PB, it is gone in one day (yes, I sit down and just eat spoonful after spoonful)."
238558,B000CRIUNA,2.0,I don't think it's my imagination or just two bad bags; Peak Protein has been changed.  I bought 2 bags from 2 different stores and there was almost no fruit in the granola.  My daughter has always wanted the cranberries from my granola because they were better than ones I could buy separately.  First the cranberries changed to not as good quality and then in the bags I bought around June or July the fruit almost entirely disappeared.  There were about 6 cranberries in the entire bag!<br /><br />I miss the real Peak Protein.  No other granola for sale is as good.  I've started making my own granola because I wanted something as good as Peak Protein used to be.  Turns out it's not that hard -- not to mention far less expensive.

Melitta brings to life the feelings of the most romantic European Caf&eacute;s."" - from the package of Melitta's HAZELNUT CR&Egrave;ME BRULEE coffee<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />There were logistical problems getting this review written. My wife brewed-up and quaffed down the entire original package without giving me the opportunity to sample. She likes her cuppa Joe in the morning, while I drink the stuff only on those occasions when I want something ""different.""

But we both agree that this blend presents neither the nuanced aroma nor flavor of anything containing caramel, vanilla, or hazelnuts. It's a decent coffee inasmuch as it's not bitter, but that's all it is - simply coffee-flavored coffee, which brings to life the romance of any ordinary brew station anywhere in the world, e.g. the customer waiting room of Bob's A-1 Auto Repair and Tires down on the corner.<br /><br />And do ""wild hazelnuts"" taste any different than the cultivated variety?"

You literally just boil the bag in a pot of water, cut it open and pour it over cooked rice (or noodles) and you're done. Instant curry dinner for one. (or two if you are just snacking) The box is marked ""Hot"" and it's got a decent level of spice or heat, but it's not hot by my standards, if you're looking for fire breathing hot curry, you'll want to add some spices of your own and do some doctoring here. But again, for a quick curry fix or snack, it'll work fine. There are some small carrots & potatoes in the packet already & they are ok, totally edible. I usually cook a small lamb chop or pork chop to add to the rice for a full meal after a busy day - makes a nice enough cold weather meal with a favorite movie type of thing."

My 125 pound mastiff has not eaten since last night. He should be hungry. I put a bowl of this food down in front of him and he sniffed it, took one little morsel, played around with it and spit it out. I gave the dog a few minutes and he did get up and eat the one cupful of food that was in the bowl. He does like Purina's wet food, that we give as a topping sometimes on another brand of dog food. I have uploaded a short video of his honest reaction to the first serving of this food. This is a rescue dog and when we got him about nine months ago he weighed 47 pounds, because he had eaten a 9"" long ratchet wrench, with the handle and the head. This dog eats lots of stuff, the couch, my shoes, the remote, but he is not crazy about Beneful.<br /><br />The bag shows big chunks of beef, whole carrots, peas, whole grain wheat. Read the ingredient list before deciding to buy. The veggies are listed at position 20, 21, and 22, after a long list of corn products and other assorted junk food. The colors are really artificially bright, some of the pieces are hard, some soft, they are a nice size for smaller dogs. At my dog's weight, I would have to feed him six and a half cups, according to the chart on the bag. I really don't think he would eat it all. I did get this bag as a Vine promotion, with the hopes that it would be really good, but I think I will have to stick with our old brand."

Comparable products offer 17 or 18 oz. for the same or a slightly lower price. So Kraft (and yes, it's a Kraft product) lower the price to get another star.<br /><br />The rest is all pro. The mouth feel is perfect; as the uploader of the customer photo states, not big bad chunks. Nice and crunchy in cold milk. The flavour is fantastic. DARK chocolate...not milk. Yum.

We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests.

77632,B001LG940E,4.0,"Since I'm a mom always on the lookout for healthy soda alternatives, I decided to give this product a shot. Its review depends on your point of comparison. As a soda alternative, it rates mediocre. As a juicebox alternative? Through the roof.<br /><br />I shared the sample with my 11-year-old son; he's the one I'm shopping for. Good eye and nose appeal, I'd say, with a light, pleasant color and a really appealing cherry scent. The flavor was sweet, but mild; carbonation gave it an extra boost. On first sip, my 11-year-old son said, ""Tastes like apple juice, with a kick."" On second sip, he added, ""It's a lot like apple cider."" (Not surprisingly, concentrated apple juice is first on the list of ingredients.) ""Would you want to drink it again?"" I asked him. ""Oh, definitely!"" he said. He took another sip. ""But I want to try another flavor.""<br /><br />I'd probably concur. I love cherry, but there wasn't much of that in this. It surely smelled good, though.<br /><br />Point by point, this seems to be on par for health value with our favorite brand of juice box, which is also 100% juice, no sugar added, and packed with vitamin C. The Switch is much higher in sugar, lower in salt. (In fact, The Switch is higher in sugar than many sodas. Coca Cola has 3.25 g. of sugar per oz. The Switch has 3.97. But it's a fruit juice, so that's pretty much what you'd expect.)<br /><br />In price, though, there's a big difference. My relatively overpriced grocer charges 6 cents per fluid ounce for our juice box brand. At the current rate of $24 per 24, The Switch costs twice that much. In exchange, you get a little added carbonation kick and cooler packaging (right down to the eye-catching logo and the upside down ""the"").<br /><br />For us, this is likely to become an occasional treat. But I think we'll give a different flavor a try next.<br /><br />Pros: Pleasant flavor, light fizz, natural.<br />Cons: High price, high sugar content, more apple flavor than cherry."

That is .02 cents per ounce more, buying it by the smaller cans.<br />I purchased a few cases of the smaller cans when they were on sale, then seen the 18.6 oz cans were cheaper by the ounce and bought four cases of them to try.<br /><br />WOW, was I SURPRISED. I have gone back to eating the smaller cans of the soup. The flavor in the bigger cans does NOT even come close to tasting the same as the soup in the smaller cans.  Why that is I have no idea. But I find the flavor of the smaller cans MUCH more flavorful and tasty vs the larger cans.  If the larger cans contained soup that tasted the same, I would purchase the larger cans every time.  But all 48 cans in the four cases tasted the same.  Something just not quite right with the flavor.<br /><br />Personal preference I am sure, but that is part of life.  I grabbed the salt and pepper mills and added a little of each to the big cans of soup.  Nope, I couldn't make it taste as good as the soup in the smaller cans, no matter how I dressed it up.  The smaller cans needed no salt or pepper, and the flavor was/is perfect, thus I bought seven cases of the smaller cans in the past three months.<br /><br />I would give it five stars, but doc it one star because of the high price.  And, yes, sometimes some of the cans are dented, but I think most of these cans, which they sell for about half of what you pay in a grocery store for them, are distressed goods. e.g. Picked up from grocery stores because they ARE dented.  A dent doesn't bother me since I am only paying about half price per can and getting it delivered for free.

Being a HUGE dark chocolate lover, I initially thought that I would really enjoy this product but it is a bit too chocolaty and sweet for my palette, so much that I cannot taste even a hint of coffee in it.  I am a daily one to two cup of coffee drinker and look forward to my early morning wake up to my brew but I will not be adding this product to my repertoire anytime soon.  I did mix this coffee with equal parts of my regular brew and it was a bit more palatable.  Hot cocoa anyone?"
246516,B002D4DY8G,2.0,"I was looking forward to a rich chocolate taste in my coffee, but I was NOT impressed with this one.  The coffee came out sour, and no matter how much sugar I added to my cup of coffee, it still had a very sour chocolate taste.  I've since added a tablespoon or so to our full pot of coffee just to use it up, and it's okay that way, but I'd soon as rather not have it included, quite frankly!"
124913,B005BHIESC,1.0,This is the worst taste for a drink ever? Its a bitter spoiled taste (to my best description  Now i'm stuck with a whole box to pour down the drain!!! Do not buy!  Just buy the regular 100% pure coconut water flavor.
76642,B0049ULB78,4.0,"Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops. My wife favors a latte or mocha, so she found Dark Magic too strong. I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast.<br /><br />I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI"">Fair Trade Gingerbread</a> I drank earlier in the week. Dark Magic is bolder than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y"">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS"">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a> but no more bitter.<br /><br />If you need more caffeine, I recommend you add a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TTG2"">SToK Caffeinated Black Coffee Shot</a>.<br /><br />In summary, I like ""tres intense"" roasts and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW"">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a> is the darkest I have found in the Keurig lineup. I will post an update should I try a stronger blend than Dark Magic.

Also disappointed in the variety.  Out of the 24, there are (5) Gingerbread, (3) Southern Pecan, & (3) Pumpkin Spice, which are all Limited Edition for the holidays.  That's about half the ""variety"" in only 3 flavors. I guess they have to get rid of these flavors. Will not order this variety pack again!"

Other listings had specified if the bags were stitched with a colored hem. This one did not so I thought maybe it was completely neutral. The item description on the actual packing slip that arrived is '3""x5"", drawstring with thin red hem'. I just wish I had seen that written out somewhere before seeing it on the actual packing slip. Otherwise the bags are nice."

17857,B0019S9XL4,5.0,"I have tried several of the Asian Home Gourmet spice packets, and so far I have been pleased with them all. The Korma curry was fantastic. You just saute onions with some oil and the spice packets. Add your chicken and stir until it is browned, add water and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Finish off with some coconut cream or yogurt. When I mix yogurt into this dish (or any curry dish) I mix a bit of flour in with the yogurt. That keeps it from curdling. Give it a try. It is a smooth, mild curry."
77067,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"While you read this review, please keep in mind that I'm not a huge granola/trail mix/nut type fan at all. Nuts only appeal to me if they are super salty. I'll only snack on trail-mix if it's got a lot of M&Ms. I'll eat a granola bar, but only if it's got enough junk food in it to render it a mislabeled candy bar. It's just never appealed to me even though I'm an extremely healthy eater.<br /><br />However, ""Chocolate Delight"" is satisfying to me. It's basically like a crumbly, crunchy lightly-sweet oatmeal cookie with small chunks of chocolate laced throughout. I didn't find it sweet OR salty, to be honest- it's just lightly sweet which makes it snackable. The chocolate isn't bitter, nor is it overly sweet- it's just the right compliment for the granola. I also like that the chocolate doesn't leave a weird aftertaste in my mouth like a lot of other dark chocolates do. There's not a whole lot of chocolate, just enough to provide a nice ""kick"" to the granola.<br /><br />It's definitely a satisfying snack because it's got some bulk to it- if you eat it by the handful, you won't feel like you've just crunched on baked air, like a lot of other healthy snacks. It feels like you've actually eaten something satisfying.<br /><br />My husband, who IS a fan of granola, said he would have preferred it without the chocolate. I probably wouldn't *eat* it if it didn't have the chocolate, so your milage may vary on that one.<br /><br />By the way- this *isn't* a cereal, as another reviewer noted - it's meant to be eaten as a snack. I'm actually anxious to try it out with my daughter when she gets home from school. She's three and an EXTREMELY picky eater. I'm hoping this might be something she can snack on instead of cereal and chips. I think the chocolate will be a huge draw for her and I can feed it to her without worrying about all the salt and sugar she's getting."

75692,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"A boost in the energy department is always welcome, whether it's for an early morning wakeup call or a mid-day pickup, and for those who don't care for coffee there are a wide range of energy drink options available. No Fear's entry into the cut-throat arena is a tasty one that I'd definitely try again.<br /><br />The flavor is a blend of fruits, which I thought tasted like peach with a hint of grape, while my wife took a sip and proclaimed, ""Definitely pineapple!"" Whatever any given drinker gets out of the fruit blend, it's definitely a better taste than the average energy drink and has a much more pleasant flavor than Rockstar or Monster.<br /><br />On the ingredient and nutrition front, No Fear has a lot less Vitamin B6 and B12 than other varieties, with most of the energy instead coming from the taurine, caffeine, and sugar.  A full can gave me a bit less of an energy jolt than a shot of Five Hour Energy, but it also didn't make me jittery at all. If you like the sugary energy drinks but want a better flavor than the rest of the competitors, definitely give No Fear a try."

At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.  I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!"
161115,B00008WUA9,3.0,"This is a nice quality cup and infuser -- it's sturdy and comfortable.  The infuser is resistant to staining and the little lid that is used to keep the heat in when steeping can be turned upside-down to act as a holder for the wet infuser when you remove it from the tea.<br /><br />However, there are some problems.  My main complaint is the design of the infuser.  The sides are a nice, fine mesh whereas the bottom is plastic with some perforations.  These holes in the bottom allow small leaf bits to flow-out.  I have a Teeli infuser that has the mesh in the bottom also and it keeps all of the leaves contained.  Second, and far more minor, the cup is rather small.  It makes a nicely sized cup of tea, but if you're used to drinking from larger cups and mugs, you will find yourself gulping this one down pretty quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad product and if it had the full mesh infuser, I would have given it 4 stars."

16919,B001LGGH40,5.0,"I received a couple of samples of these at a food service show recently and was pretty impressed. Kiwi berry was my favorite, sweet but not too sweet and the sparkling water kicks it up. The orange tangerine was very tasty as well, I am a fan of delicious flavor. They have no added sugar, but still plenty (29 grams) of sugar that naturally occurs in the fruit concentrate the juice is made from...versus 39 grams in a can of regular Coke. My go-to juice drink is still Fruit 66, but the Switch is a very close second!"
17233,B00474G3BU,5.0,"Lived in California for several years and was introduced to Tajin via Mexican cuisine.  I used to limit only to fruit, I loved especially on apples, pineapples, and watermelon.  After moving to the midwest I couldn't find in any store (I now live a very small town.)  So spoiled being able to buy at Walmart or Target when we lived in Cali! I ordered via Amazon and thought an 8 pack would be too much.  But after reading reviews here I was convinced to go beyond fruit and sprinkle onto savory items.  WOW, all the reviews were right, I literally use this on almost everything now!  I love it on pizza, sandwhices, spaghetti, chili, beef stew, mac and cheese, steamed veggies, it really adds that extra ""oomph""!  I introduced co-workers to it and gave two of them one bottle each and now they're hooked, too!  I leave a bottle in our common kitchen at work and pretty much use it daily at lunch.  The 8 pack is a great deal and received lightning-fast with my Amazon Prime membership.  Thank you so much, Amazon, for making this available!"
82695,B005UP1M4I,4.0,"These capsules work well and I am very satisfied with how they compare to the Nespresso coffee capsules.<br />Couple things to remember to avoid disappointment:<br />1. Use good quality coffee, I use Illy, Lavazza or Starbucks<br />2. Make sure you grind the coffee beans at the grocery store to espresso fine<br />3. Fill the capsule to the top with your ground coffee, do not under fill or you will get watery coffee.<br />4. Pack the coffee in the capsule by tapping the spoon down, but don't pack it down too much or you will not get good flow.<br /><br />These capsules, when used as above make a delicious crema (froth) , just as enjoyable as the Nespresso but for a total cost including capsules, shipping and coffee of under 30 cents each compared to Nespresso at 60 to 68 cents each.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

123594,B0083WYXC8,1.0,"In fairness, Pillsbury does warn that the product may have a ""laxative effect"" due to the malitol, isomalt and sorbitol.<br /><br />However, I have eaten all of these before and didn't expect this much of an ""effect"". Oh my goodness. I will spare you graphic details but will say I am just now un-cramping AT ALL and it's 20 hours after I ate the product. I had about 2 tbsp.<br /><br />It could be the sheer amount (of malitol, I'm assuming - sorbitol doesn't usually do this to me) that's required to make the frosting taste really sweet that is the problem. I can't say for sure.<br /><br />I gave it a star because it does taste very frosting-like. The ""feel"" is frosting-ish too. Tastes very close to the real thing, at least to me. But this sickness afterward is not worth it, I was actually getting scared at one point. Buyer beware, and if you try this, taste a VERY SMALL amount -- maybe 1/4 teaspoon - at first to see if you are going to have effects. Then work your way up."
76573,B0049ULB78,4.0,"I'm on the second k-cup in the box and find myself comparing it to Green Mountain Coffee Espresso Blend which I've been drinking for over a year now.  The box reads, ""offers the rich aromatics and flavor qualities of espresso"".  Even Keurig is recommending Dark Magic to those who previously purchased the Espresso Blend.  Another reviewer wrote this coffee was: ""Strong but flat, lacking definition"".  Well, it does taste watery compared to the espresso blend and lacks that burst of flavor in every sip.  I'm not a big coffee drinker but love making daily lattes and cappuccinos from my Green Mountain Espresso Blend and now Dark Magic coffee.  This coffee is barely acceptable for this purpose but it is acceptable for someone who likes a strong/bold cup of coffee."
148929,B004Q3LBTG,3.0,"Update: Thanks to the wonderful folks at Lowe's they got the stripped screws out of the bottom of the item, and I purchased some new better quality screws to put back in it.

I think as easy as the belt comes on and off that is something that should be addressed whenever the company goes to make a newer model.<br /><br />Received this off my wishlist for Christmas and was excited to use it, it steamed the veggies just fine, however it would not blend. The blade and its unit inside the baby food maker would not spin. I noticed other people on here have had the same problems. I tried to call the Baby Brezza company at 9:23 am EST since on their website it says their business hours are 9-5 EST. However their automated system would not let me speak to a customer service representative, you have to leave a message. Sorry, I want to talk to some one and NOT wait to be called back at YOUR convenience, but rather MINE. I gave them their chance, so I now have to wait to receive the Amazon invoice in the mail from my mother since she is the one who purchased it here on Amazon for me, and then I will be printing a FREE shipping label and returning with ease through Amazon. I was really looking forward to this baby food maker, however, I think I am going to be going with a different brand. This thing is a piece of crap. IT is so disappointing to try to make your baby food and to have this thing not work; on top of that, their customer service has disappointed me too."

78893,B000HK9IKG,4.0,"My family uses stevia as their sweetner.  This chocolate stevia is pretty good.  The price is not bad although I wish it were a little cheaper.  My son uses it to sweeten plain yogurt and we use it in milk for chocolate milk.  It is a real help when I am trying to raise my kids having as little sugar as possible.  It is kind of hard to do when all their friends eat cookies, candies, juice, soda ect.  They feel like freaks because we don't have any of that in the house.  So stevia helps me out to be able to give them something sweet."

133140,B0090X8IPM,1.0,"I am one of the biggest Starbucks fans and have tried nearly every blend of coffee bean they have.  While I am not a huge fan of flavored coffees due to the nature of the artificial flavoring they add when Starbucks came out with ALL NATURAL Fusions I was intrigued.<br />I have tried all three blends they offer: cinnamon, vanilla and caramel.<br />Caramel blew me away and I loved it and the description on the bag of vanilla had me guessing it would be the same subtle syrupy sweetly decadent taste that I would like.<br />Not even close.  The vanilla did not impress me at all the while the scent of the coffee smelled heavenly and even my kids remarked on it, the flavor was off putting. The aftertaste made me grimace and I slogged my way through the first cup and offered one to my husband who did not like it either. We poured the rest of the pot out.  I took to to work and brewed a pot and two of my coworkers loved it so to each their own.<br />I would not buy this flavor again or the cinnamon but I have bought multiple bags of the caramel.  I am glad Starbucks is making natural flavored coffees and is a leader in the industry by being the first to do so."
249682,B001LGGH54,2.0,"I was expecting a better tasting drink for something that claims to be 100% juice.  Maybe it's the carbonation and sugar combination, but the taste was too strong and tasted like a carbonated piece of hard candy (think Jolly Rancher).  I'm not sure how healthy this drink could be considered since there are 140 calories and the drink is only 8.3 fl oz.  For that many calories, this drink has to be loaded with sugar.  Maybe the drink could be used as quick pick-me-up drink, but if you're going that route, you're probably better off buying an energy drink since the cost wouldn't be much different.  Switch drinks are about $1 a can."

My wife didn't care for it, but I really liked it! Ok, so all it is is carbonated fruit juice.... big deal, right? But it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience. I hate diet soda because it just doesn't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it. However, this drink has no sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives.

237552,B000NNB1I4,2.0,"I bought this decaffeinated Midsummer's Peach tea directly from Harney, when they had it on sale for $5.95 a tin. I don't know if there was some mixup with the decaffeination process or what, but the tea in the tin I received certainly had some sort of stimulant in it -- if not caffeine, then something just as potent. I know tea contains theophylline and theobromine as well as caffeine. But I was expecting less of a stimulant effect from this tea than I get from regular tea, not more of one. I'm still baffled as to whether I received ""caffeinated"" peach tea that was mispackaged, or whether the removal of the caffeine somehow increased the amount of theophylline and/or theobromine enough to offset removal of caffeine.<br /><br />As for the flavor, I was a bit disappointed. It's not the worst tea I've ever had, but usually Harney tea tastes better. The peach flavor wasn't even the best ""fake peach"" flavor I've ever tasted. And if the tea doesn't have the benefit of no caffeine (or other stimulants), you might as well buy a better tasting tea."

No pesticides/chemicals have been used in growing this tea, it is pure, it is natural, it is rich in taste and above all it is healthy.<br /><br />It is produced by CAYKUR (Rize,Black Sea Region,Turkey), Turkey's government enterprise for tea-processing.<br /><br />Caykur's Altinbas is usually priced higher than other Caykur brands.<br /><br />It is loose tea so you need to have a set of two teapots, one at the bottom for boiling water and one at the top for brewing tea."

It does take 2 packets for a decent mug of soup, and you really do need to let it brew in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.  Adding croutons does help, but overall it's not that great-there are better offerings out there.  I don't think I'll get another order, sorry."

It's actually a blend of several different juices, plus the ascorbic acid, and the blend does not meld at all.  It's just bitter, overly sweet, and has a nasty aftertaste.  Gross, gross, gross."

The ""sauce"" was what was really sickening.  I don't see why they would have changed the sauce recipe just for some branded can, but they simply must have.  It's downright disgusting.<br /><br />If I had any sense I would have spent a buck and picked up a can at the grocery store first.

If you aren't over a rug or other cloth surface it's not a problem, because they'll lick it off the floor.

The color was one strike.  The dogs don't need it, they can't see it anyway. Another thing is the corn.  With corn being the main ingredient, it can't be healthy.  Who eats that much corn in a meal.  If dogs were out in the wild, they sure wouldn't walk up to a cornfield and think, yum! corn.  They would chase down the mice first!<br /><br />The dogs did eat it but they weren't excited about it.

When this huge box arrived my wife and I couldn't believe the size of it.  We had a good laugh unpacking 24 bags of Smart Puffs and ate one bag full right away.  The puffs tasted quite good and with the reasonably healthful ingredients they contain we did not feel guilty eating them.<br /><br />The puffs have a pleasant natural cheese taste.  However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air.  Is that strange or what?<br /><br />I think I would like a bit more substance to my snacks, but I guess one can't have it all and still remain reasonably healthy.  Smart puffs do not seem like junk food.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, your fingers do not get all yellow eating Smart Puffs.  I have ordered my second case of Robert's Smart Puffs."

After looking all over the Internet for them, I got the message that they were now called ""Cry Baby"" instead, so I very happily plunked my money down, looking forward to the eye-wincing sourness that made the old ""Tear Jerkers"" so magnificent. But these seem sweet rather than sour; the sourness lasts only for a moment or two and it is not the wonderful bone-shaking, salivary-gland-aching, grapefruit-in-the-eye-squinting sourness that I remembered. So, yeah, they're good. They're just not great. I miss ""Tear Jerkers"".  :`("

77022,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I liked this product, for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />One is it's all natural. We get no preservatives, or corn syrup processed in any of it's many incarnations. We get oats, and chocolate. And who doesn't think chocolate should be one of the major food groups?? It's dark chocolate to boot, so not full of sugar and sweeteners that we don't need.<br /><br />The other reason I like it is that it isn't too sweet. It's definitely not a cheap bag of 'trailmix' from those major stores that's full of candy, dried sugar covered fruit mixed in with some nuts and oats perhaps. The only sweeteners I could find on the label were molasses, evaporated cane juice, and brown rice syrup. The semi sweet dark chocolate has some sugar in it, but that's ok, sugar is natural, as long as you don't make it one of the primary ingredients.<br /><br />A nice healthy and tasty snack food, that's what you'll find here. I don't think the kids will be too disappointed in the taste, it does have chocolate after all."

I don't know if there's a chance that the bottle was mislabeled and really is some other extract, but I won't be able to use this product to flavor things with a rose flavor.

Keep in mind, I live in FL and in a townhouse, so it was not left on my doorstep, but in my mailbox. Had I not checked to see the arrival time (which was supposedly tomorrow), I would not have not known it was delivered today. My candy would have sat in 80* degree humidity until I got home from work tomorrow. Then I opened the box and the handle to the present was already broken. Not that it's a big deal, but now I have to go buy a basket or bag to put it in and make it pretty again. I was very excited because my brother grew up in the 80's and this is his birthday present. Thought it was a very cool idea, but I ended up being pretty disappointed. I haven't even looked through the candy yet but I could tell you, for $30+ shipping, I was expecting a lot more... hopefully my brother will like it after I fix it up."

These bags are 1 oz which means that they are perfect for kids and adults who have a problem with portion control.  In our house the rule is you get 1 bag... and that's it.  And the fact that there are 22 bags means that there's an assortment for lunchboxes, or for kids who can't agree on whether they like Doritos or chips better.<br /><br />As for price, the current offering is ridiculous and I'm going to ignore it and pretend that they don't really want to go to the storeroom to sell any.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger"

But, I love peanut butter but hate the calories, so I decided to take all the good reviews to heart and give it a go. I was honestly shocked when I mixed up my first tablespoons. It felt, looked, and smelled like real peanut butter! The taste is very close...obviously it's not going to taste exactly like real PB, but for the calories you are saving, it's surprisingly on target. Also, when you eat it with other things, as most people do, you don't even notice the difference. I spread it on toast and topped with honey...and it was SO delicious!!!<br /><br />A 45-calorie serving is two tablespoons mixed with one tablespoon of water. Be warned, this makes quite a small amount of peanut butter. It is just enough to coat one slice of toast, and actually, I would like a tad more. So yes, this stuff is very expensive and you don't get very much."
132776,B000HG84EQ,1.0,"Hoping for a more 'natural' tasting snack, I chose to buy this.<br /><br />It is disgusting.<br /><br />The taste is okay, but what really ruins this product is the texture.

167203,B002GWM8OG,3.0,"While I am not a coffee expert, I appreciate French roast coffee.  Upon opening the bag, it was apparent that the coffee did not look like French roast as it had brownish hues, not black, and it did not have an oily sheen.  I made the coffee in a French press and my observation was confirmed, it did not have a French roast flavor.<br /><br />On a positive side, the coffee was well packed in resealable bags for those who don't have, or choose not to use, airtight containers.  The coffee was not bad, it simply was not what I expected."
248689,B003SG8GYK,2.0,"Back in the day, when they were still available in the United States, Crispy M&Ms were my favorite M&Ms.  So you can imagine my excitement, when researching Crispy M&Ms online to see if they might make a comeback in the US, when I discovered that I could buy them NOW from a German company on Amazon.  So I placed an order and they arrived.  Well, while they are Crispy M&Ms, they don't taste as good as I remember them.  Maybe it's my memory or maybe the chocolate is different in Germany.  They tasted more like malted milk balls in an M&M shell.<br /><br />On a side note, if you purchase this item, you might experience a delay in shipping like I did because you have to sign for them in order to take delivery.  They arrived via USPS who left me a card to sign.  I signed the card and my carrier left them two days later."

256179,B000OQBL0I,2.0,Love twix and since I can never really find it in my area I thought I would buy it from Amazon. Great price for a box of 24 the only gripe I have is that the expiration date is right around the corner - meaning I have to start eating these things NOW!!! I would have appreciated at least a year expiration time but I only have close to 30 days to eat 24 bars. I like to eat my candy in a casual setting not in a rushed setting - but we live and learn. I took three stars away for that reason and for the reason below.<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted the seller over 3 weeks ago to complain about the expiration dates and they have not returned my emails or even let me know they were concerned. They sell OLD STOCK that is expiring soon. I would not advise to buy from them and I would and will not buy from them at all again.

My pen rejected the surfacea at first but I kept trying and it ended up drawing just fine. I posted a picture of my Lego Pops. Hope this review will be useful in making a decision. FYI, to my disappointment, most 7 year olds did not like the taste of the Marshmallow Lego Pops (I used the yellow Wilton candy melts).

It was very sweet like most energy drinks are, but it was loaded with B12 and B6 vitamins, which I liked. It gave me energy and got me through my workday. I could concentrate and work easily without feeling over stimulated or jittery.  As far as energy drinks go, it did its job well. I would recommend it for anyone interested in a little boost in his or her day."
163873,B004E4FUGW,3.0,"I picked this up at a local supermarket today after recently watching an advertisement on TV. Man, they got me good. Once you flip the top, it has one of those ""no mess"" type nozzles that squirts out only as long as pressure is applied to the bottle. Kinda neato. In terms of the actual taste and flavor, I used 8oz of water and initially, one half-second squirt of Mio Liquid Berry Pomegranate flavoring. I stirred it for a bit, and after much heart-wrenching anticipation, I was...not overly impressed. The initial resembling taste that I could recall would closely mimic that of Propel Water. It has a similar after taste after smacking the lips and tongue a bit.<br /><br />I found that if you really want it to be flavored water and not water with a hint of flavor, you have to use much longer squirts. I tried a one-second squirt, and my water tasted much better. I could really taste the berry and pomegranate flavoring, but not impressive enough to have a second glass. It advertises 24 servings per bottle, but I can't imagine what little flavor you will be tasting if you really tried to stretch it to 24 servings. In my case, maybe more like 10-12.<br /><br />My dealbreaker with this is that it provides no nutritional supplementation (i.e., antioxidants, vitamins, electrolytes, etc.), such as Propel, Vitamin Water, etc. So it really does just enhance the flavor of water. Seriously? I never thought water tasted that bad to begin with. But for mutants that have a hard time knocking back their non-flavored daily H20, this might do the trick. It's kind of cool to try out of novelty, and it definitely doesn't taste bad (they also have a plethora of yummy-delicious sounding flavors). But other than that, I can't imagine this being a household item. This is definitely not as cool as the bad boy putting is his pocket carrying with him around, as the commercial depicted. But one day if this does have nutritional supplementation, then watch out, because it's gonna be epic."

Yes, the dogs don't care what the treats look like, they only care about taste, and most things are tasty to them.  However, for someone who loves to make donated treats, this is a little expensive.  Not that I can find it anywhere cheaper than here, but just overall, a little more.  Just makes for having to charge a little bit more for the product you sell."

I thought ""sweet and spicy"" meant medium hot since it wasn't called ""Sweet and hot"".  This jerky is hot.  It is hard to appreciate the jerky or the sweetness of it if your mouth is burning.  Actually, it is not burning red hot, but is a little too hot for someone who likes spicy to be a little less than medium on the hotness scale.  The jerky itself is wonderful - just the right amount of tenderness and chewiness.  If you like a little less than medium hotness, then try a different flavor of their jerky - they're great!"

Now that I'm living in rural Alabama, I turned to Amazon to get the product that I loved.  I ordered 3 different cases.  It was a mess when it arrived.  At least two of the jars were broken when it arrived at my house.  This sends the price per unit price up.  Two years ago, I got a sliver of glass stuck in my finger. As my body worked to push it out, I developed a tumor that needed to be surgically removed.  To say I have a broken glass phobia is an understatement.  I also through the entire shipment away instead of digging through the glop to find my unbroken jars, but these are tough economic times, and a baby's got to eat.  After sitting back down to the computer I decided that the 16 packs you get with Happy Baby pouches were more cost effective, and they don't run the risk of breaking."

77113,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I've found Back to Nature products to be somewhat ""hit or miss.""  I LOVE their Classic Granola -- it's probably my favorite ""plain"" granola, perfect mixed with peach yogurt or eaten with milk.  Their Summer Berry Blend cereal was, to me, wayyy too sweet and the flakes were thick and hard.  I'm sure someone somewhere will absolutely love it, but it wasn't for me.<br /><br />This Chocolate Delight Granola is somewhere in the middle.  It works great as a cereal, eaten with milk.  The flavor is reminiscent of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  The sweetness level was just about right, and the amount of chocolate was nice.  I'm not sure I'd want to eat it for breakfast, but for a snack, this works great.  I also tried it mixed with vanilla yogurt.  I used a 6-oz carton of vanilla yogurt, and added about 1/3 C of granola.  This worked well, too.<br /><br />Straight out of the box -- this doesn't work for me.  The chocolate chips have a sort of off-putting texture that seems to disappear with milk.  The cereal is kind of crumbly, so you don't have a huge amount of large clusters to grab onto.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a ""snacking"" granola that you can nibble right out of the box, this might not be what you're looking for.  But if you're looking for a tasty chocolate, relatively healthy, granola to eat with milk or yogurt, this stuff is pretty darned good."

17837,B0001FQVCA,5.0,"I had seen Nutella in the States growing up but didn't really become a heavy user until I lived in Europe for a year. This stuff is amazing - it's super chocolatey with a hint of hazelnut that gives it a really full-bodied, mature flavor. I usually put it on bagels or English muffins as a quick, satisfying dessert. It's also great for baking (Nutella brownies are awesome!)<br /><br />In terms of nutrition, the calories per tablespoon of Nutella is pretty close to the American sandwich staple, peanut butter. Nutella doesn't have quite as much protein as peanut butter but it also doesn't have as much fat or sodium, so there's a trade off.<br /><br />All in all I LOVE this spread and I always have a big jar in my pantry."

82694,B005UP1M4I,4.0,"I was skeptical at first, but since I like to drink nespresso (ristretto/arpeggio) as well as coffee from moka I thought I'd try. These capsule are not perfect, but provide a good alternative.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- you can grind the coffee you like (I have used, so far, Illy beans and beans from the KC Roasterie)<br />- coffe has a density and creaminess typical of Italian baristas, you can actually taste the layers of the beans and the (small) crema blends well with the coffee<br />- you can save some money, or get better quality beans for the same price as Nespresso<br /><br />CONS:<br />- it takes a while to practice with these capsules (at least 20)<br />- coffe has still some variability (occasionally it comes out watery, but when it is well done it is way better than Nespresso)<br />- it's a bit messy (so not good for your office machine)<br />- foil does not always seal perfectly<br /><br />With time, I realized that the following steps improve a lot the quality of the espresso you get:<br />1. poor small amounts in your capsule and press heavily each time (secret for a good and rich espresso is how the water goes through the coffee)<br />2. seal tight eliminating as much air as possible<br />3. MAKE A RISTRETTO. If you drink long Nespressos, this is not for you, as the coffee will not be strong enough. The amount of coffee in the cup should be about 1/3 of a small cup with illy logo (yes, very little, that's why it is called espresso).<br /><br />I will buy these products again and try with other beans.

254974,B001L70JBG,2.0,"Recently, I was over watching the Celtics game at my friend's apartment. As the game grew more and more intense, I consequently grew more and more parched.<br /><br />""Hey Brian,"" I said. ""You got anything to drink?""<br /><br />""Yeah!"" he replied. ""I've got some lavender soda in the fridge.""<br /><br />""Lavender soda?"" I asked, skeptical. ""Where does a person even get lavender soda?""<br /><br />""It was sitting on a table next to a couch in the furniture section of Marshall's, so I bought it."" Brian replied.<br /><br />I walked to the kitchen, my interest piqued. Drinking lavender soda sounded like a wonderfully unique experience, as I typically enjoy the scent of lavender soaps. However, I would soon learn that drinking a flower-flavored soda would not be the exciting experience I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />When I took my first sip, I thought to myself, ""What have I gotten myself into this time?"" The initial flavor tasted like club soda that had been poured into a glass that contained soap residue from a previous cleaning. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""Perhaps the flavor is just subtle at first."" However, as my drinking experience continued, I came to realize that this would not be the case. After I swallowed the soda, I was faced with an aftertaste that, rather than tasting like soap residue, tasted simply like soap. Like a bar of soap was in my mouth. This brought back horrible memories of my childhood...<br /><br />You see, when I was but a young boy, my mother would always threaten to ""wash my mouth out with soap"" if I either said a bad word or said something disrespectful to her or my father. Being one to always question my mother's conviction, I often found myself with a bar of soap in my mouth. This had a tremendous, lasting psychological effect, as even twenty years later I can still taste the flavor of soap in my mouth when I consider saying a bad word. Consequently, when I took my first taste of lavender soda, I was hit with a flood of emotions. I felt as though I had said a bad word or broken a rule. I felt as though I was being punished for something but could not recall what I had done. My vision began to become cloudy. I began to lose control of my small motor functions. I was soon reduced to a bluthering mess on the floor after being bombarded with such deeply-buried memories. I vowed never again to sip of such a soda as long as I shall live, lest I suffer another episode such as the one described above.<br /><br />In summary, this soda tastes more like lavender-scented soap than it does soda. It might be better suited for a more delicate palate than my own, but I, personally, do not prefer it."
77648,B001LG940E,4.0,This is actually a very good tasting juice. Many cherry flavored products I've tried taste more like an apple juice combo but this has a strong cherry flavor.<br />They do not seem to be as highly carbonated as soda. Honestly I don't think the carbonation does anything for the drink but it doesn't hurt it any either. Maybe good if you need to fool your kids into thinking they are getting soda.<br />The cans are only about 3/4 the size of a regular soda can. I would like to see them come out with a 2-liter version.

238373,B001VNKZUU,2.0,"I thought this item would be a good addition to try on the diet I've been following.  I was looking for a low sodium, vegetable flavor.  The brand I usually use DOES make a vegetable flavor, but not in the low sodium variety.  I have not opened the package of Frontier as yet.  I was not happy after reading the label.  The first ingredient listed on the label is, ""Corn Syrup Solids.""  There is a carbohydrate content, a sugar content and a relatively high calorie content, comparatively speaking.  My usual brand has about 10 calories per serving. Frontier's has a calorie content of 60 per serving.  Frontier website states, ""Frontier Natural Products Co-op specializes in natural and organic products.""  I did not expect to get sugar in their soup product, albeit a less sweeter one.  Lower dextrose, nevertheless is still sugar.  If you look on their website, this is what Frontier states about the product:  "" Vegetable Flavored Broth Powder, Low Sodium  - Use this rich flavor blend of tomato, onion, garlic, carrot, basil, celery seed, kelp, parsley, spinach, turmeric and bay for soups, rice and pasta. Pure, natural taste-without fillers, hidden ingredients, artificial flavors, preservatives or colors.

I foud this one to be too overpowered by the Vanilla.  Even after I mixed it 50/50 with a non flavored coffee it still was too much ""flavor"" for my tastes.

152273,B004OVATO8,3.0,"I had looked forward to trying out these healthy snack bars, and wound up with mixed emotions about them. Here are some pluses and minuses:<br /><br />Pluses<br />(1) The ingredients in these bars are tops in nutritional value -- vegan and gluten free.<br />(2) The packaging is convenient for carrying the snack in a purse or briefcase.<br />(3) The sugar content is high enough to satisfy, but low enough to still be healthy.<br /><br />Minuses<br />(1) The bars are so sticky that it is difficult to remove them from their wrappers, and the contents stick to your teeth as well as your hands.<br />(2) If you refrigerate them, they become less sticky but too tough to bite and chew.<br /><br />Suggestions<br />(1) It might help if the bars were dusted with powdered sugar (or perhaps rice flour) to reduce their stickiness.<br />(2) Perhaps something less sticky could be used to bind the components together.<br /><br />I was very disappointed to discover that I cannot use these bars for my afternoon snack -- they are just too hard to handle.

Another reviewer gave it props for not having any refined sugars, but who cares what kind of sugars it is when it's still nothing but sugars! Even if it's fruit sugar it still has the same high calorie count and candy-like taste. And it's a tiny can for nearly a dollar! Sorry, it's not worth it. If it were good, my kids would probably drink 3 at a sitting. Imagine the expense and packaging waste!"

But expensive gadgets and doodads would just angry my blood up further, so I'm seeking Samadhi on a shoestring budget.<br /><br />When my wife goes to a spa to relax, she always gets some kind of oatmeal facial scrub treatment. I don't know much about pampering, but I'm intimately familiar with a wide variety of hot breakfast cereals. If oatmeal on the face is relaxing, then I'd sure give it a try.<br /><br />I heated several packets of the oatmeal in the microwave, per the cooking instructions, added a little milk and layered it onto my face. I'm not sure what's supposed to happen next in a 'professional' treatment, but in my bathroom, a lot of it just glooped off into the sink. The rest felt... well, like oatmeal on my face. Sticky. Warm. Lumpy, in a way that was less 'relaxing' and more 'get it off my face-y'.<br /><br />The oatmeal did smell nice, and made me sort of hungry, but I don't think I relieved any stress by putting it on my face instead of IN my face.

77039,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is a great product, but it could be better.  Specifically, the granola did not have uniform clusters of chocolate.  Some clusters were large and had adequate chocolate coating while others were small and had little or no coating of chocolate.  Because of this I gave the product one less star than I would have had the product been more uniform.  That said the product was otherwise great!  For granola lovers (or even those who don't regularly consume granola) the addition of chocolate is quite clever and actually changes the expected taste and texture of granola.  I decided to try sprinkling the product over top some vanilla ice cream and couldn't believe the wonderful experience.  Adding some walnuts and a little extra Hershey's dark chocolate syrup was incredible.  You can of coarse consume the product straight from the bag, but if you want to stretch the product out over a number of weeks I would recommend using the chocolate granola as a topping of sorts on your favorite desert.  I would highly recommend this product."

It is without a doubt the best cup of coffee I have ever had all machines, Europe, French Press, ect. ect.

77044,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"CLUSTERS: If you're going to call them clusters they should be only a bit smaller than popped corn kernels.  These clusters are so small that you couldn't even call them that if this was cereal.  What we've really got here is a granola cereal with bits of chocolate in it to be eaten a pinch at a time.<br /><br />CHOCOLATE CHUNKS: Looking at the granola through the window in the packaging you would think you could hardly taste the chocolate, like when you're eating Chips A'Hoy and somehow get a cookie that only has a couple of chips in it, but you actually taste plenty of chocolate in every bite.  It's very good, not too sweet, and very chocolatey without murdering the taste of the granola--which is also delicious.<br /><br />WHOLE GRAIN: There are two main reasons why whole grain is good.  First, it's more filling; one sandwich made with whole grain bread is as filling as two sandwiches on white bread for example.  You simply wont feel the need to keep stuffing yourself and that will reduce your total calorie intake by hundreds of calories per day if you have whole grain snacks like this one in addition to whole grains in your meals. The other is that whole grains range from tougher to impossible to metabolize, so your body works harder, burning more calories trying to do that (calcium does this too by the way, so it's a good idea to take a swig of milk with your whole grain snack).<br /><br />One added feature of whole grain is that it adds volume to your stool, so make sure to have that plunger at the ready if you're suddenly adding whole grain foods to your diet.<br /><br />PACKAGING: If I saw this on the shelf in the supermarket I would assume it's a cereal to put milk into or to top yogurt with.  Whomever designed the packaging and omitted the word 'snack' should be flogged.<br /><br />WITH MILK, EATEN WITH A SPOON: Hey, guess what, it is good as a cereal.  A half cup serving, with milk, would be about 350 to 400 calories I guess, which isn't bad for breakfast.<br /><br />THE F-WORD: Yes, it's got fat in it, like all granola, but since it's not in bar form, molded together with marshmallows or corn syrup you really shouldn't worry about it.  'Fat is the flavor' as the saying goes, and that warning only purtains to people who somehow think one bag of cookies should be eaten in one sitting.  Even the suggested serving size here is quite large for a snack.  Personally I found myself eating two pinches of this granola whenever I went into the kitchen to feed an urge to eat something, and that was enough to do the trick.  So don't worry about the slightly over the line fat percentage.<br /><br />If you're really worried about gorging yourself not only on granola, but ice cream or crackers and cheese and other delicious little goodies, don't bring the whole container with you to the living room for your several hours of nightly television.  Instead, put any snack you're going to eat in a 6oz custard cup and don't fill it more than three quarters of the way--which is about half a cup since it gets wider towards the rim.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: There really isn't any supplement that can substitute for getting your nutrients and whole grains from actual food such as granola.<br /><br />This is really delicious, healthy, proper snack food to get you through those periods between meals when you just want to stay satiated, keep your energy level up, and reduce any cravings you might have for something bulkier and with more calories."

Unfortunately the honeymoon didn't last long because within the first few hours of ownership he chewed off 1/4 of the green middle part. He starts with the nubs and gradually works his way onto larger chunks. He is always supervised with new toys and lucky for us he isn't a swallower of large chunks, although I'm sure we will find our fair share of green nubs in the yard tomorrow morning after his usual morning business - a nice little St. Paddy's day treat for us all!

Frankly, I think I would prefer the aluminum over BPA.

I looked up and tried several different recommendations, particularly with regards to what temperature to use.  The most helpful was a recommendation to place 3-4 kernals in the pot and wait until they pop before adding the remaining kernals, but this still did not produce the desired result. The method and temperature made no difference.  While the packaging is labeled ""mushroom popcorn"", I'm really not sure that's what I received.

79653,B004TJD758,4.0,"I tried this from a single serving packet from Whole Foods. It's yummy and has a fruity berry-ish taste with a purple color. It mixes well but you have to keep shaking to keep it mixed. I tried this with 16 ounces of rice milk, but I think it would go better with juice or possibly water alone. I mixed it the night before and it did not turn thick and gloppy the next morning. It's good and I'd recommend it but I like the orange creamsicle flavor better."

Thinking maybe I'd done something wrong, I tried again with the same result. Next time around I used two pods, no cream, and no sugar hoping for a stronger cup. No dice. I really like the idea of the coffee, the organic certification, fair trade certification, charities and initiatives they support, but come on, make me a stronger and more flavorful cup!

246264,B005AO12RG,2.0,"The Arcor Coffee Caf&eacute; is a dark brown, filled, hard candy; hard and sweet on the outside with a coffee filling that is delicious. However, the amount of filling varies tremendously from piece to piece. I had some that were more filling than hard candy, while others were all hard and no filling. The yummy filling was a real crap shoot; maybe yes, maybe no. The outer hard candy was sweet with a little coffee flavor, but tasted kind of strange. Most of the coffee punch was in the filling. Coffee was 4th item on a list of ingredients that numbered 8. When the filling was plentiful=6 out of 10; when there wasn't any filling=3 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies.<br />  God bless. Mike"
249435,B001LGGH54,2.0,"The Switch Watermelon/Strawberry can is 8.3 oz and contains 140 calories. That's the bad news. The good news is that it contains no sugar, no corn syrup (that sneaky ingredient that is making its way into everything these days), no preservatives, no artificial colours and is gluten-free.<br /><br />So what does it contain? Juice, juice concentrates, filtered sparkling water, natural flavours and vitamin C.<br /><br />Taste-wise, SWITCH is a bit on the sweet side for me. There's a very light strawberry flavour but I couldn't pick up a hint of watermelon. Would I buy this? No because the calorie content is too high and I tend to go for fresh juices when I want juice. If I was stuck in a restaurant would I pick this to drink over nasty sugary soda? Only if they were out of water."

148676,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"These things are definitely big, definitely have peanuts and peanut butter, and they're chewy. But they're also rather boring. You REALLY have to like peanuts to be able to work your way through one. It feels like something's missing -- a little sweetness, a little salt -- not sure what it is, but something would help. I asked the techs on my production crew to test a couple. Bear in mind that they'll eat anything from a craft service table, but they also found them lacking in some essential ingredient.<br /><br />The bars also get a bit mushy to the point of being messy when warm.<br /><br />If you're a big fan of peanuts and peanut butter and that's all you want, then these bars are for you. If you need a little variety in your treats, then maybe go for something with a little chocolate or other added flavors.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I've hurt your feelings, Mr. Peanut. I've always been a big fan."
77608,B001LG940E,4.0,"I was a little leery of trying this product, partly due to the fact that I am not a particular fan of anything that is a cherry flavor, even something that claims to be the juice of cherries.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, and am now a fan of this drink.<br /><br />The black cherry juice isn't the primary ingredient, but I think that prevents the flavor from being too overwhelming.  The primary ingredient is apple juice, then grape juice, and then the cherry juices.  The apple and grape juices only provide a crisp, clean base for the cherry flavor, because I don't taste either of them.  All I tasted was the light, refreshing black cherry juice flavor.  There was no unpleasant aftertaste and it wasn't overly sweet.<br /><br />Definitely chill this before drinking.  It is lightly carbonated (no shaking the can!), has no added sugar but does have added vitamin C (100% of the 'daily recommended level').  A serving is one 8.3 ounce can, 130 calories.<br /><br />Overall, this is a bright, clean-tasting, refreshing drink that won't feel heavy in your stomach and does provide some vitamin C to boot."

However, the Roland figs are ""tougher"" then Oregon.  The only guess I have is that Oregon picked their figs later or processed them in a way to make them more tender.  However, if you are fan of canned figs you should buy them.  The taste is nearly the same as Oregon but the texture is more firm which may not bother other buyers."

Just the right amount of carbonation and sweetness, and I really loved the fact this has no corn syrup or refined sugar. The small can size is also very handy because it's easy to slip into a bag and it's exactly one serving size. As I mentioned with the other flavor, this drink doesn't have a weird aftertaste or leave a lingering flavor on the tongue--it's very clean and refreshing."

I immediately went on a search for the product and finally found it in the gourmet section of a local grocery.  Then, I found it on Amazon... and a LOT less expensive!  BREATHE DEEP tea has not only helped me with my respiratory issues (asthma, bronchitis, chronic sinus congestion, etc.), I've shared it with family members and friends who are also amazed at what one cup of BREATHE DEEP tea can do.

The flavor of the chocolate pieces is not as intense as I would like (in terms of my chocolate consumption, I typically eat dark chocolate) and the granola itself is nothing extraordinary.  It's a little drier than many other granolas I've had -- not a bad thing once you put it in a bowl with some milk, but it makes snacking on it out of the bag a little more difficult since the granola pieces are so small.<br /><br />If I could rate this using half stars, I would probably give it 3 1/2.  Since that's not possible, I'll bump up my rating to 4 stars."
151423,B000EDDSES,3.0,"It seems hard to find great muesli these days. I think this is one of the better ones, and I do buy it. However, I wish those making muesli would heed the latest nutritional advice. For example, nutritionists say that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is important and that we generally get too much of the omega-6 fatty acids and not enough of the omega-3's. This muesli would be a lot more nutritious if it replaced the large amount of sunflower seeds (high in omega-6 fatty acids) with walnuts (high in omega-3 fatty acids) and almonds. And to me that would make it taste better too. I also wish they would make a version without all the raisins and dates, allowing one to add fresh fruit (e.g., raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, etc.) instead of dried fruit.<br /><br />I was in Australia last spring and found great muesli there not only meeting these nutritional criteria but tasting better than this or most other muesli. To me nuts are an important part of good muesli. But I'm being a bit of a purist, I know, and a friend tells me I'm a food snob, so take my opinion with that in mind!"
82303,B0060JMVM0,4.0,"This was a pretty good olive oil.  I tried just dipping my bread in it to see the full flavor and this is my conclusion, even thought I freely admit I am no expert or anything.  First thing I noticed was the viscosity of it, pretty thin.  I don't know if that is good or bad, just an observation.  I figure this is good for salads, and didn't have too much effect on me dipping bread, but would rather have it a bit thick.  The flavor was good, not great.  It didn't have the rich fruity, nutty flavor I was hoping for, but was OK.  I had been using Pompeian and think I prefer its flavor better, at least in dipping.  After I use this up I will go back to Pompeian, its cheap at wmart and to me has the best flavor of any I have tried.  Conclusion is if you want a thin, light oil then this is a good choice, for a more robust flavor, there are better options."

148884,B004Q3LBTG,3.0,"I think this machine is nice and the steam and blend cycle is nice but it takes an insignificant amount of extra time to dump food from basket directly into the blending container in the Beaba.  So as far as this difference I don't really think it is significant enough to go with the Brezza.  Beaba now makes a larger machine also.  I guess the cost is a little less for the Brezza but because of the disadvantage I am about to mention it absolutely does not work for me!  I chose the Beaba because you cannot put your jar or small glass container right into the Brezza to defrost or reheat like you can with the Beaba because of that middle rod that is part of the blades.  It is completely in the way in my opinion and they force you to use their plastic containers to store and reheat food!  I freeze my baby food in these tiny glass lock containers because I try to use glass when I can for storage.  I also buy the glass organic pre made baby food when I don't have time to cook as a backup and I need to be able to warm those since the baby doesn't eat the whole jar yet so I store left overs in the refrigerator.  You can put the jars and the glass containers directly in the Beaba basket to defrost and heat and I could not use the Brezza to do it.  I would have to defrost at room temp or in fridge then transfer to heat which takes way too long and I would have to transfer to the brezza containers which are plastic and then heat.  Not only this is completely time consuming (I do not use the microwave it irradiates your food, destroys nutrients and it is horrible!) it is also plastic and even though BPA free I am trying to avoid plastic like I mentioned so just steaming and blending in plastic is already too much for me so for storage I use glass only.  So this is a good machine but if you are looking for defrost/reheat function where you can put your own containers and jars into this machine will not work."

Twice the thickness of other gingersnaps and very small (around 1 1/2 "" in diameter), they have little or no ginger flavor. This alone would have discouraged me, but the bag I received was also burned. They weren't simply very browned; there were burned spots around the edges, and the bottoms were blackened.

132771,B000HG84EQ,1.0,"I initially wanted to make my own fruit leather but in a fit of impatience, purchased this brand. The only other fruit leather I had before this was the Archer's Farm brand (Target) and honestly, I felt like the taste and texture of Stretch Island did not measure up. After the disappointment began to settle in I started doing more research into the ingredients and process involved in making fruit leather and stumbled upon some eye-opening information. Most companies are trying to market their fruit leather as a healthy alternative to the sugar/corn syrup fruit snacks but in reality, there is little difference in the amount of sugar you are eating. When a product like fruit leather is produced commercially, it often contains fruit concentrates (Stretch Island is made almost entirely of concentrates). Knowing nothing about that process I researched it and found how fruit concentrates are made and how the process destroys nutritional value and dietary fiber that would be found in homemade (or a higher quality brand) fruit leather. While this may be a good alternative to someone who is eating a lot of junk food, people who are already health conscious should be aware that this is borderline junk and holds very little of the fruit's original vitamins or dietary fiber but ALL of the natural sugars. Yes, I know, fruits have a lot of sugars...but when I eat something made from fruit I want to eat all the nutritious parts too...not just the sugar left over after heavy processing."

I know the difference because I've been using real Greenie's for month's to hide medicine from my 13 year old dog.

80016,B00065AQ4O,4.0,"Mayonnaise is an interesting product, cool, smooth and creamy it's the lush counter partner of the low cal mustard but it's of those things people think they don't like until they taste it in the proper way and that's all it takes for a secret love affair with luxe sauces  and recipes that can be made with it to start.<br /><br />I am a big fan of sandwiches and any new way I can spruce them up, especially with nice sauces and spices is always at the top of my new ideas to make for lunch or to fill into an interesting menu on the weekends. The Rouille is spicy, that I deducted just from looking at the angry orange color in the jar, the color of auburn harvest on a stormy night. The taste is of cream immersed in a sea of chili peppers and garlic with a peppery background. My favorite way to eat it is in a sandwich with a leftover cold coconut breaded chicken cutlet with some crisp romaine in between two toasted crusty slices of bread smeared on the inner sides with the Rouille spicy mayonnaise . The taste is a tropical rendition of a Caesar Chicken Sandwich I get at Hale and Hearty here in NYC but much easier since I made it at home and it took no effort.<br /><br />Great on bread, meat or as a condiment to any afternoon snack or smeared on some California roll for a spicy finish.

247981,B004T3QMD8,2.0,"The first ingredient is sugar, the second is nondairy creamer which is made of corn syrup solids, partially hydrogenated coconut oil, sodium casenate dipotassium phosphate etc. There isn't anything real about this product. In addition, these artificial ingredients are some of the worse for your health. The claim that it has 0 trans fat and so it's okay to ingest, doesn't tell the true story - that hydrogenated coconut oil is terrible for peoples health (cholesterol). What's even odder is that coffee (instant) is way down the list, and as far as pumpkin, well there isn't a drop of pumpkin or spice to be found!<br /><br />However, if you're one that doesn't sweat the ingredients list, I can say that as advertised this instant (just add boiling water or hot milk) coffee pumpkin spice drink does produce a frothy latte foam (reminds one of a chemical reaction in science class). The color is of a milky light tea. The taste is very sweet, and vaguely reminds one of cinnamon stick. Overall, not the best choice for a cold fall eve."

However, the nutrition information is given by 38g serving, not by tbsp or ""scoop."" I measured it out with my food scale and 38g came to exactly 3 level tbsp, so if I made the Iced Chocolate as directed (2 scoops/8 tbsp), I'd be getting almost 3 servings of chocolate mix (420 cal before the milk!). I cut the milk in half (3oz hot and 4oz cold) and use one serving (38g/3 tbsp) chocolate, served over ice, and to me it is delicious with a nice strong spicy chocolate flavor, and it is a reasonable 217 cal when using skim milk.<br /><br />Different palates are going to have different preferences as far as the balance of spice and chocolate, but I can tell you that I like it.

It seemed like a good deal at the time but when I got home and opened it, the smell was pale in comparison to Urbani.  There is NO comparison.  The (lack of) fragrance from the La Tour was like smelling the remnants of an old truffle bottle.  The headiness from the Urbani is unsurpassed.

No, I think the sauce is okay overall, and I'm sure I'll find some food to match well with it, but when you get something called ""bold jalapeno sauce""  you don't expect to be getting the world's mildest sour cream. Overall> not gross, but not a ""bold"" original flavor either. And it is NOT ""jalapeno"", so if you're looking to actually try something spicy - run away from this rip off."
151151,B001Q9EFW8,3.0,Normally when I take out treats or bones for my dog she starts doing her tricks right away and whining in anticipation.  When I take this box out she doesnt even get up. When I hand her a bone she lets it drop to the floor and just sniffs it.  Sometimes she'll eventually eat it. Other times she just walks away from it.  I will update my review after she's been using them for a while to report back whether her teeth are any cleaner.  That's assuming I can get her to eat them.
166676,B000KEK6W8,3.0,"This is very easy to use, just brown up 1-1/2 lbs. of diced chicken and simmer in the sauce for 15 min.  We prefer it on basmati rice, and like a little yogurt or labna in the sauce.  Pataks' sauce has a slightly sweet flavor, and is only a little spicy (the jar says hot, but it wasn't by our standards).  We ate it with some chili relish and mango pickle, to kick it up a notch. Usually we use a dry mix for Rogan Josh by Shan, or make it from scratch and personally I prefer these better, but they take 2-3 hours.  We also usually use beef, which I may try this with another time.  For something fast and easy it certainly fits the bill."

76981,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Back To Nature's Chocolate Delight Granola is so chocolatey it was almost too much for me. I definitely prefer it as a snack, not a breakfast food, it was just too sweet for breakfast. The good thing is, the sweetness and the chocolate meant I didn't need a very big serving to satisfy my sweet tooth. I tried it both as a traditional cereal with milk as well as out of hand as a snack. I think I enjoyed having a handful for a snack the best. It's your basic granola of sweetened oat clusters plus chunks of semi-sweet chocolate. The cereal must have a dusting of cocoa on it too since the milk turned kind of chocolatey when poured over it.<br /><br />Marketed as delicious, simple and wholesome (which it may well be) one should not get the idea that it's either low fat or low calorie. A 1/2 cup serving is 220 calories and 6 grams of total fat (2 grams of saturated fat) and mostly sweetened with ""evaporated cane juice"" (um, that's essentially sugar with a euphemistic name and some trace minerals) so it still needs to remain in the ""treat"" category."

131477,B000I63LV6,1.0,"Plain and simple. It is advertised ""just like the original from the 60's"" but THIS poor excuse of a retro experience is full of ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER causing this drink to have an after-taste from you know where. Sucralose was not invented until the mid 70's!! Imagine TAB but with a taste of kids cough syrup and you pretty much know what I am talking about. This company had the choice to use sugar JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL or use Sucralose and they chose Sucralose. If you do not know about Sucralose, use this link ( http://tuberose.com/Sucralose.html ) to read more than you ever wanted to know about this government endorsed ""cigarette"" of the new millennium. They lied to you about smoking back then, they are lying to you about artificial sweeteners now.<br /><br />Just how few studies currently exist on sucralose is an issue. Endurance News provides the following table illustrating this fact:<br /><br /> Sweetener -- # of Studies<br /><br /> Saccharin -- 2374<br /><br /> Aspartame -- 598<br /><br /> Cyclamates -- 459<br /><br /> Acesulfame-K -- 28<br /><br /> Sucralose -- 19<br /><br />The same patterns with aspartame (NutraSweet/Equal) are repeating with sucralose (Splenda). Their claims of product safety and research results are identical to those used by The NutraSweet Company.  Note the comparisons and repetitions between the products, the corporations, and marketing.  Maybe now, consumers can prevent damage to human health sooner than with NutraSweet, which has damaged the health and lives of millions of innocent consumers since it was placed in the public food supply in 1982. Has the FDA repeated the aspartame approval process for sucralose, allowing a product with proven carcinogens to flood our food supply?  Only time will tell, as it has with aspartame. Yet at the cost of human lives.Knowledge is power.  As an educated consumer, you have the awareness to choose what you and your family will ingest.  Unnatural artificial sweeteners may affect your health.  Why take the chance? After twenty years of NutraSweet (aspartame) dominating the sweetener market, people are realizing for themselves that aspartame really is a foul food chemical tragically harmful to their health. Now, people think Johnson & Johnson's Splenda, made from sucralose, has come to the rescue as the newest chemical sugar replacement ""made from real sugar."" People don't want to hear that it may be just as dangerous as aspartame, and this white knight of sweeteners is no better improvement. New chemical sweeteners (like Splenda) and the sweetener blends (aspartame, sucralose and acesulfame K blended together in one product) may be causing users to show signs of weight gain, disruption of sleep patterns, sexual dysfunction, increases in cancer, MS, Lupus, diabetes, and a list of epidemic degenerative diseases. The corporations continue to stand tough in their denial of any connection to chemical sweetener additives. The dangers of aspartame are now widely known, but the risks of using Splenda are not documented - until now. Splenda may not penetrate the blood brain barrier as aspartame does, hence entering the brain and creating neurotoxin havoc at the brain center, but Splenda CAN adversely affect the body in several ways because it IS a chemical substance and not natural sugar."

I have to give the nod here to Bear Creek for just being a little spicier, and in my opinion having just a tad better beef broth.

240094,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"My dog likes this -probably more than his regular food.  However, this is not the best choice for a healthy diet for him, in my opinion.  I was actually surprised at the ingredients. You have to go down the ingredients list to item number seven to hit beef, which is the first real meat on the list, and five of the first eight are grains/fillers.  The peas and carrots they show on the bag fall in well behind sugar, sorbitol, salt and potassium chloride, but at least ahead of the four artificial colors added.  Sorbitol is both a sweetener and a laxative and not something I'd have my dog on for any length of time.<br /><br />I think if your dog is a really picky eater, but likes this food due to its flavor and different shapes, then it would be ok and better than not eating enough.  However, this is a pretty low quality food compared to what else is on the market.  Grains and animal by-product should not be the first four ingredients in your dog's diet, unless it is the only food your dog will eat day after day.  I will be switching my dog back to Authority Lamb and Rice and leave him on it until he tires of it or they change the recipe.  It is only slightly more expensive than this food, but he needs less of it (less filler) on a daily basis, so it probably works out close to the same cost.  It also isn't the best food on the market, but it is much better than this one with more meat and less fillers and additives, and it agrees with him."

79749,B0025UCI94,4.0,"Seriously, I was very happily surprised with this excellent brown bread. I found it to be nice and moist, with the texture and even the taste reminding me a bit of fresh gingerbread or a good rich muffin. The problem I had, however, was not insignificant. I exchanged emails with a very nice and accommodating representative of B&M, and apparently I got a can with inside walls that somehow escaped being thinly coated with vegetable oil. Hence, especially since the inside of the can has horizontal ridges, vertical to the direction that the bread needs to be slid, the can had a fiendish death grip on the bread. The instructions say you may need to ease the bread out by using a spoon. If only. This only creates a cave in the bread, maybe useful if you are into bread sculpting. Even using the cutaway lid, which should be the perfect size, you just keep compressing the bread on that side, of course with every quarter-inch or so of compression you're losing slices you paid for. The simplest way for me was sliding a thin steak knife around the edge, but since, again, the can has those internal ridges, you end up mangling/losing part of the product. Overall, ordering this bread as long-term backup is perfect for me, so I will probably order again. But it is a little depressing that we just launched another rover to Mars, to join another that is still operational, yet we can't manage to get a simple vegetable oil coating consistently inside of a can of bread. Out of twelve cans purchased by yours truly, so far I have opened four, each time soon wanting to call emergency services to bring in the Jaws of Life, but then figuring they might be needed more out of the highway.

I bought it when I was using my Delonghi EC155 - but it went belly up and since it was my second one of the same machine, I bought my Citiz w/ Milk because Ethical had just come out with their capsules (those work fine for me and I like the Cremosa) and I thought I'd give these Ne-caps a shot. (pun intended) So, after watching the videos and trying various ways of tamping, I pretty much gave the tamping up, too, much like Keith did. I have a small coffee spoon, I fill the capsule to over flowing give a light tamp with the back of the spoon, and scrape off the excess with the handle. I do five in the morning (or the night before) for the 3-5 espressos I'll drink throughout the day. From pulling the coffee out to sealing the capsules and putting the coffee away takes less than 2 minutes - and the espresso using my Illy is just great! Every once in awhile I'll have one that does the dribble thing, but hardly ever now that I have my system down. I use them with the little rings for the newer machines. How someone can say that they don't work in their machines is beyond me, I don't think they tried them or they didn't use the ring or they over tamped the capsules.<br /><br />As to cost, yes, each capsule is 20 cents empty, but the Nespresso capsules just jumped up a little over 5% to 60 cents a capsule plus shipping. My espresso needs would be cost prohibitive if I used Nespresso exclusively. I do plan on buying some of the lungo capsules in decaf for my few friends who don't do caffeine, but since I've never had any other than the sample capsules of Nespresso I'm not missing anything and really, it's Illy in my ne-caps...Illy (and the Lavazza when I run out of that) (I may have a problem)"

I think it's really a healthful drink, and am looking forward to finding it in my local grocery store. Oh, it just occurred to me to phone them and see if they will start carrying the product. Thank you Amazon for providing this product for us to try out."

162983,B00437GAQ4,3.0,"I like Bugles, but I didn't like the overall result with this particular version.  I was put off by the rather icky pasty coating of chocolate and peanut butter that covers each Bugle piece.  I thought it detracted from the Bugle flavor and texture, and that the Bugle part detracted from the chocolate and peanut butter flavors (which are not that great to begin with in this product).  They don't taste bad, but the overall effect is sort of limp and rather off-putting, even in the appearance."

75643,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I frequently drink energy drinks and have tried most of the major and some of the lesser known brands. This ""No Fear"" one is decent, really nothing with it, but also nothing great. The drink contains 87mg of caffeine per serving (take note, a can contains 2 servings!), which is about average, as well as the usual mix of vitamins and other energy-boosting supplements. The taste is comparable to what you'd expect from an energy drink - you probably wouldn't pick these things up because they taste great, after all.<br /><br />All in all, there's nothing much that sets this drink apart from the pack, and because of that I'd rather go for the brands I am already familiar with. (My personal favorite, by the way, is the orange ""Hydration"" version of Rockstar, which actually tastes surprisingly close to orange soda, has a lower sugar content so it doesn't dehydrate you as badly as other energy drinks, and still gives you a solid boost!)"

I like the crunchy texture and I didn't think it was too sweet.  It's very good mixed about 1:3 with Special K or other unsweetened cereal.  It would also be good as an ice cream topping or yogurt mix-in, but it's just too rich to eat by itself as cereal or snack."

77890,B001LG940E,4.0,"I tested two flavors of Switch soda, and I liked the Black Cherry flavor the best.  The first sip made my taste buds start dancing; it was full of flavor. Not the super-sweet, overcompensating with sugar to cover up the lack of real taste kind of flavor, either.<br /><br />Have you ever eaten a pile of chilled cherries on a hot summer afternoon? If so, you'll know that every so often, one of the small fruits ripens to a deeper flavor than the others.  You'll be snacking along, and then... BAM! that one special cherry makes you sit up and take notice.  Well, that is what the first taste of Switch is like.<br /><br />Maybe my taste buds went into overload, and shut down, because the flavor-palooza didn't last.  My last sip was good, and I enjoyed the drink, but it just didn't deliver that same ""punch"" with every tip of the wrist.<br /><br />This soda is what I'd call ""lightly carbonated"".  I find that a plus, as it's not burp-inducing. But, if you're looking for a fruit-fizzy, you might be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a nice Switch from the usual soft drink fare and it's full of healthy goodness. I don't think I would enjoy drinking this everyday, but for an occasional treat, it's lovely."
255428,B0037YXQ5W,2.0,"Wow. Apparently I have different taste buds than the other reviewers - and that's okay. I just personally find the strawberry flavor to be disgusting. I haven't bought Instant Breakfast in a long time, but I don't remember it tasting like that before.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recommend the strawberry variety, but it is a good product in other flavors. Also, I have purchased other groceries through Amazon and been very happy, so I would recommend this method of purchasing it if you do like it."
17237,B00474G3BU,5.0,"A close friend who loves great food and seasonings introduced us to this seasoning, and we fell in love with it.  It takes fruit to a new level for your taste buds, and almost everything tastes better with the lime, chile pepper flavor.  It's not too spicy for those who are not chile heads -- but gives food a 'pop' and 'zing' we like.<br />We had a casual evening with other friends and brought along our personal bottle for a dish we planned to share.  They flipped over Tajine too and immediately began trying to find it in their home state, Colorado!  After hearing that they had been unsuccessful, we shipped a small case to them as a surprise gift -- and it was a hit.  It keeps well in the pantry and is a delightful lift when slicing an apple for an afternoon snack.  Can you tell we like it?"
77651,B001LG940E,4.0,"I don't care if it is just juice concentrate, reconstituted with carbonated water instead of plain water -- the stuff tastes good!  The carbonation makes it taste nice and light, instead of super-sweet or -strong like many juices.  As a heartfelt devourer of all things cherry, I really liked this Switch black cherry drink.<br /><br />On the other hand, it was so tasty, so light, so refreshing, that I easily could have knocked down three or four of these SMALL 8.3 ounce cans.  However, seeing as the primary ingredient is (reconstituted) APPLE juice (that's right, NOT cherry!) and the tiny can has 130 Calories of sugars (natural to the juice, I'm sure, but still) - it is probably a good thing the can is so small, or I'd have had 500 calories just like that!  Even Coke only has about 100 calories per 8 ounces!<br /><br />Anyway, Switch tastes awesome.  When I get more, I want to try it as a mixer with vodka.  And I wish the flavor was a little bit more cherry and less apple/grape."
256522,B003JA5KBW,2.0,"I only got to test one packet which gives limited testing results. I found the one packet gave me no extra energy, the taste was OK but too sweet and a bit artificial tasting. Since I only got one little packet I can't see the print well enough to read the ingredients, there was no box. The color is too bright to not be artificial. This reminds me of koolaid but more expensive. I really don't feel it is worth buying and I won't be buying it again. I think if they would make it all natural then maybe it would taste and look better."
131046,B0002L3BYE,1.0,"I was very excited about this product (among others).  The thought of being able to satisfy your sweet-tooth without fat/calories/carbs seemed too good to be true.  Well, it was.  This product tastes like chemicals.  I tried it with different things, such as chocolate pudding or fruit, and nothing helped.  I had to scrape it off because it was so disgusting.  I'd stick with cool whip, only a couple more calories, but it tastes great!  I do however, enjoy the other Walden Farms products (caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, french onion dip).  The honey bbq sauce is my favorite."

A wonderful taste of peach, no funky aftertaste, and even when you smell the whole leaves in the bag, it smells like peach.<br />Try it, you'll be amazed by this tea like I am."

18051,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"I was skeptical about this peanut butter product at first, but when I tried it I was pleasantly surprised!  The ingredients: peanuts, salt and sugar.  Doesn't get more pure than that!  I'm on the old Weight Watcher's Points plan and this PB2 is 1 point for two tablespoons! As a comparison, two tablespoons of ""regular"" store bought peanut butter is 5 points. The taste difference between this peanut butter and store bought peanut butter is so slight that it's not worth the extra calories to buy the ""ready to eat"" peanut butter.<br /><br />This product comes in a dry form. You add two tablespoons of the dry mix to one tablespoon of water, stir, and you have delicious peanut butter!!  It can be added to smoothies, to!!!  I would definitely get this product.

They're good, but I don't like them as well as some of the tropical fruit chews I've had. Plus, they're just not the best imitations of the fruits they're supposed to represent. It would weigh on your personal taste, of course. One thing I like about these chews is that they don't seem overly sweet. One thing I don't like is that they come in individual wrappers and these are the toughest wrappers to get off that I've ever found in candies. I finally had to go and find a scissors. Fingernails just don't work. Don't even think about trying to open one while you're driving.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

However, for some reason a number of bars in the box that I received weren't terribly fresh. Some of the bars had that light, chalky color on the outside. This doesn't mean the chocolate has gone bad, just that it's been around for a while - though these older bars were also a bit more brittle than the newer ones.

The Kashi brand is not too sweet, and cooks easily in the microwave.  (I tend to use a little bit less water than recommended.)  Personally I don't find any oatmeal all that filling, but my wife does.<br /><br />Also, she recommends oatmeal to any nursing mother and claims that it will increase breastmilk supply.<br /><br />The green tea is a neat idea, since it's supposed to be ""healthy,"" but we really don't notice it: we don't notice any green tea taste, nor do we notice any caffeine effect.

Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter.

77822,B001LG940E,4.0,"Note: The zeros were cast by a troll and her gang, not real and decent people, and are against me personally and not the book or the review!<br /><br />Switch is a new, delightfully tasting carbonated drink. I love the equal blend of black cherry flavor--light and refreshing, with the light kick of the fizz of carbonation and the bubble feel in my mouth! In fact, that's how Switch bills itself: A perfect balance between juice and carbonation. That's my rave over this new drink.<br /><br />Now here's my reluctance to embrace the drink with five stars. I poured the 8.3 fluid ounces into a small glass (I have a huge collection of mismatched, but adorable clear glasses of all sizes, including this little bowl wine glass I removed from a college cafeteria in France many years ago). The glass held the contents of this tall, thin can of cheery cherry drink perfectly. But wait, by the time I quaffed the contents, I held the glass askance and asked: Is that all? I want more!<br /><br />In comparison my favorite beverage, Zero Sprite, holds 12 fluid ounces, a perfect amount to quench my thirst after a few hours working in the yard. I add ice to Sprite and don't care if it is watered down, but this Black Cherry Switch? No, one does not want to water down this exotic flavor. It must be drunk straight.<br /><br />As for its can slogan: ""100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't,"" I'm not sure about that. Let's examine it. ""What you want"" is ""100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All natural, Carbonated, Great taste and refreshment."" I agree with all of those. So far, so good.<br /><br />Let's look at ""what you don't"" want: ""No sugar added, No corn syrup, No preservatives, No artificial colors, and Gluten free."" True on all those.<br />Next the label. This is where it gets confusing. Total fat 0g, Sodium 15mg, Total Carbs 35g, Sugar 33g, Protein 0g, and 130 calories. The 33 grams of sugar can be confusing. If none was added, then the 33g must come with the natural juice. And Switch does bill itself on 100% juice.<br /><br />In comparison my Sprite can contains 38g of sugar and 140 calories. I thought Zero Sprite contained zero sugar. My bad. I didn't read the label. It is free of caffeine, fat, cholesterol, fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, but no mention of sugar, which I assume comes from the corn syrup.<br /><br />I'm no nutritionist, but it seems that drinking Switch is much better than drinking a Zero Sprite, except that the can is larger so you get more.<br /><br />I would change those four stars to five now, except 8.3 Fl OZ still is not quite enough for one drink.<br /><br />Will I switch? No, but I will add Black Cherry Switch to my fridge for an occasional delightfully refreshing drink when I don't need more. Or else, I will have to trudge up to the headmaster, hold out my cup, and plead: ""May I have more, sir?""<br /><br />Wouldn't that be embarrassing at my age?"

So, as I opened the box it became more and more apparent this really wasn't a good product....you know when chocolate is old it turns light brown or whitish??? Well, that's how ALL of the jelly rings looked. This box was nasty and I would never order from them again...very disappointed"

I had only had the ""brisk"" version before and wasn't such a Lipton fan, but I needed tea and bought it.<br /><br />Contrary to the rather dusty, mild (watery??) taste of the ""brisk"" American version, Yellow Label has a good flavor and no bitterness, even when brewing for 6 min (I brew a small pot with three bags in the morning). Not quite as rich as Assam tea when mixed with milk and sugar, but a good substitute. And you can't beat the price. A very nice, full every-day tea."
17198,B006JG8ALK,5.0,My husband loves this product and eats them frequently.  I personally do not care for coconut but have found these to taste similar to the cocont part of an Almond Joy or Mounds candy bar without the super-sweetness.  They consist of only two ingredients which is appealing to a few of our food conscience friends.

Since it has a mild sweet taste to it, it will ruin the flavor of the soup.  She is picky, what can I say.<br /><br />Finally, after many tries, we finally figured out a way to feed her the cereal:  mix the cereal with formula/milk; pour into a pan and warm it up on the stove; while heating it up, stir constantly to ensure they are mixed together; once well mixed, let it cool and then pour into bottle to feed.  I had to cut the silicone nipple in order to accommodate the thick liquid.<br /><br />We feed her this mix once or twice daily.  As she grows, formula/milk alone do not last as long as they used to.  To keep her stomach content, night time feeding is essential, so she does not awake from hunger in the middle of the night.  A bit of work, but I think it is worth it."

Best used by date was 4 weeks in the past the night I got them, and if I remember right these come with somewhat generous time periods, so these must have been very old.  Back they go, while a hassle I am pretty annoyed, was so excited I made some tea way to late at night when they arrived and now have a caffeine buzz and no biscotti :)"
251905,B0033YXSHW,2.0,"I like most of this company's line a lot. But this one has some problems. The first reviewer talked about there being little chocolate. Well, I found plenty of chocolate, but it wasn't very good. Poor texture and a sort of waxt taste. More important, there's something in it that feels like large grit. I can only imagine that it's the pears, cut a bit close to the core. I haven't picked it apart to see what it is, because I don't much care, and it puts me off of buying any more. (That's with milk.) So, not their best effort, I'm afraid. Somehow, I don't think it's going to be much of a success. The indulgence of chocolate sure doesn't go with the gritty texture of what else is in there. Probably the #5 is a better alternative if you want chocolate."

Although it does not cause the gas ""problem"" with excess consumption, I will stay with the Honey Tree. Note: I have used Honey Tree instead of Karo syrup to make almond-crusted pecan pies. It produces a pronounced gas effect, as I always eat large slices of pecan pie. I intend to make a pecan pie with this product and if I believe it is better than the Honey Tree pies, I will report back."

17450,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"Recently purchased the Keurig Single Cup Brewer. Love the convenience and no filter or pot to wash. Tried the sample K-cups included. All were good but the Newman's extra-bold was outstanding. I had been buying an organic blend that I thought was good until I tried this. I was hooked but this was almost like buying printer ink, very expensive. The 80 pk is about two pounds of coffee. Amazon pricing is $48 dollars which equals $24 dollars a pound. This is pricey, you are paying for the convenience. Other retailers mark this up even more making Amazon look cheap. I found this at BJ's wholesale club for $37 dollars. Not that much cheaper but it is a savings. Bottom Line: The Keurig Brewer is a fantastic coffee machine that works best with the K-cups. Newman's extra-bold is an organic coffee that is superlative to other brands and worth the money. My advise is to shop around for the best price."

245687,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"I have been ordering this for a few months and it started out GREAT. But the last one we received is probably the last one I will order.<br />When we started getting this the selection was a nice variety and was just what we were looking for. But then they began to have bunches of the same flavors and little variety.<br />But the final straw is the package we got today. They usually come it their own box, but this bunch came in a plain brown paper stapled closed bag that was sealed in a plastic bag. This offered little protection to the K-cups, since several of them were slightly damaged. Plus, all but one of the K-cups was Green Mountain flavors and there were many of the same flavors.<br />Basically, I believe I would of been better off just ordering the Green Mountain flavors we like, it would of been cheaper in the long run."

77739,B001LG940E,4.0,"I'm reviewing based on taste and whether or not I felt it is worth the money and if I'd purchase it again.<br /><br />First, the taste was wonderful. It reminded me of the cherry pop I drank as a kid but a little lighter and less syrupy and less bold. It has a great sparkle to it, refreshing (unlike a lot of carbonated beverages in my opinion), and yummy. It was like a little can of cherry delight.<br /><br />Second, it's listed for about $23.00 here on Amazon for a case of 24. That seems expensive given the cans are small. However, looking at the nutritional features of the drink - 100% vitamin C, no preservatives, added sugar, etc. - it seems like a better deal. But then again, I'd be more likely to buy these for my son and not myself so in that case, I'd probably be more likely to go with the flavored water juice pouches which are less expensive and have the vitamin C and no sugar, too. So unfortunately, I don't see these as being a great value.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Taste 5/5<br />Value 3/5"

236898,B001OQXEHK,2.0,"I tried this litter at the suggestion on someone's suggestion in the grocery. It lasted a long time for him and his multi-cat household and locked in all the odors.  Unfortunately, it didn't work well for me.  Kitty didn't mind it and there was no dust flying up when I scooped out the stinky solids and fluffed the litter(huge plus), but if I didn't change it every 5-7 days, the yellow-soaked grains would start to smell stale and then downright stinky.  The stuff costs too much for that.  I tried Fresh Step Extreme instead and that stuff is amazing.  Of course, I have to contend with the dust, but again, Kitty doesn't mind it and it smells fresh and masks the odors of the waste as I remove it.  I only change it once every 3-4 weeks, but I do clean her box everytime she uses it."
253904,B003VKR0EU,2.0,"To add to the pile-on, really really hate the new packaging. Saw the reviews here and thought ""Come on people, it's just a package,"" but then when we actually had to deal with it (after having used the good ole fashioned big round canister). No, it's not world ending, but it's just unnecessary annoyance that you don't need when you're low on sleep and changing poop-filled diapers all day. I suppose on the bright side, the new packaging likely helped to justify the continued employment of a few folks in Enfamil's Brand Marketing department (""Based on our focus group testing, modernizing our packaging will boost sales by .14%!""). In this tough job market, I say good on 'em.<br /><br />As for the formula itself, well, it's formula. Our baby drinks this just the same as if she were drinking generic Costco formula. We put out the extra cash because this mixed better (i.e., it doesn't clump), but the annoyance factor of the new Enfamil packaging actually made us start considering alternatives. Then we saw an article today on Huffpost about infants in China developing breasts because of hormones in formula. It also mentioned the lack of regulation in the US on using milk or milk products (e.g., formula) from cows that have been injected with growth hormones. That was enough for me. Organic formula it is.<br /><br />Ciao Enfamil."

My very favourite drink got pulled off of the market for no other reason than because of its controversial name.  ""No Fear Energy Drink"" has an eye catching can design and what's inside had a decent berry taste.  Many drinks are either sickeningly sweet or have funky aftertaste due to the taurine and other ingredients. No Fear was better than a good many better selling energy drinks.  As for its properties:  it really was rather mediocre as far as how much of an energy 'boost' that it gave."

249644,B001LGGH54,2.0,"Overall, I was not thrilled with the taste of this product.  At first the watermelon and strawberry did come through pretty clearly, and that was a good sensation. But following very quickly was a distinctly light, thin metallic taste, and this taste lingered well after.  It wasn't the iron-specific taste of metal you'd get from blood, or even the filtered metallic taste you might get from eating liver, but more the metallic taste you get from water steeped in a porous metallic tankard.  It wasn't so bad that I spit the product out, but most definitely noticeable.<br /><br />You've got 140 calories in 8.3 ounces.  Yes, there is no added sugar, but there's more than enough of it in the concentrated juices which make up the product.  I usually drink diet, so am used to beverages packing less than a calorie.  The sweetness came through most clearly.<br /><br />They play up the carbonation on the packaging, but the carbonation was nowhere near the level of your typical carbonated cola.  The carbonation was rather light, with very little fizz, pleasant and mild.<br /><br />I note the presence of acerola, again.  I saw this in my trial acai beverage, too.<br /><br />Bottom line: Thanks, Amazon, for yet another free drink.  It wasn't bad, not at all, it was only okay, and not something that I'd seek out or spend any of my own money to purchase."

17073,B000F2VESU,5.0,"I would have to say this is one of my all time favorite foods.  My personal favorite way to eat it is to roll it into balls then place the balls into a shallow dish of freshly brewed green tea ('pi lo chun' in case you wondered).  Sometimes I use a flavored green tea as well and I also use other teas, black, herbals and even a couple of rooibos taste good this way.  That is about Thai Sticky Rice in general though, now let's talk this particular bag of the stuff.<br /><br />I got this with free two day shipping through my Prime membership so no worries there, the price per pound winds up quite reasonable at $2.34/lb. so that's great too.  It cooked up easily and nicely and I was able to roll it up as well as any I have had, that makes four good things and now the taste... I really liked this one a lot.  It is a nice and tasty rice and it sticks together well and soaks up the tea nicely without having the balled up rice disintegrate into a handful of soggy rice in my hand (yes, I do in fact use my hand to eat this, rather my fingers. 8-)<br /><br />I think I will lay in a supply of this one for sure...

Its a GREAT product, and I love being able to have all my creations *sugar free*.  HOWEVER, I guess since the spring harvest has officially started and canning of jams/jellys is offically underway, the price has been jacked up by almost 100%.  I had come back to buy more, (remember I place my first order just over a month ago) but I was shocked at the price increase. Instead of buying from Amazon I'll be buying from the manufactuor, where I can get 2lbs (32ozs) for under a hundred dollars, including shipping. I know the star system should reflect the product, which in my opinion is top notch.

Once more, the saltiness was so overpowering, one couldn't even eat anything without having to rinse the dish off.<br /><br />The tastiness of the black beans and garlic is there, but the saltiness is way too overpowering and is too much to take in."

I cannot explain the disparity in strength rating between teabag and tin for the Irish Breakfast tea.<br /><br />My reason for buying Irish Breakfast tea was for my first cup of tea, higher strength than their English Breakfast tea.  Amazon should correct this by getting Twinings to send updated images.  Similarly, written descriptions fail to indicate Twinings tea strengths using Twinings tea leaf rating system.  This should also be corrected.  My supplier's and Amazon's processing were both superlative."

17729,B000Z978SS,5.0,"If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best.  It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their ""100% satisfaction guarantee"". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item ""powdered"".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products."

For starters, the first three ingredients listed on the back are: Ground Yellow Corn, Chicken by product meal, and corn gluten meal.  These ingredients are hard-to-digest fillers that make the dog feel full and chemically boost the protein count up (remember the reason behind the melanine poisoning a few years back?) but offer little to no real nutrients.  As we go further down the list of ingredients, there are non-specified sources of meat and bone meal, food colouring, wheat glutens and even propelyne glycol.  For an in-depth analysis of these ingredients and their real purpose, additional research can be done online on dog food advisor sites and even the recall analysis sites.<br /><br />While I would not call this ""candy"" for dogs as so many people do, it's definitely junk/fast food for dogs.  A dog can eat this food and have most of the nutrients required in its diet chemically met, but it's like raising a kid on happy meals. Chemically the nutrients are all there, but it's just not good quality nutrients and contains a lot of filler.  The result is the dog eats more because it gets hungry more and also causes it to poop more.  If one does have to feed this food to their dog, I would recommend supplementing it with healthy treats and vitamins.<br /><br />When this bag of food arrived, my (non-food obsessing) dog was immediately attracted to the bag and pawed at it and sat next to it while giving me to ""look"".  For the sake of testing this food, I obliged by giving her a piece or two which she immediately ate and begged for more.  A week later after being on this food, she has daily mild indigestion and has vomited small amounts of undigested food back up and poops 3x a day up from her usual 1x a day.  The poop is larger, softer and not so firm as her poop when on her previous food (California Naturals Lamb & Rice).  While she seems to like the taste/smell of this food and seems to be excited at meal times, daily vomiting and multiple poops is showing that she is not tolerant of one or multiple ingredients in this food. I will be switching her back onto her previous food that she had no problems with.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This food is not as healthy, nor does it contain high quality ingredients as the packaging and adverts claim.  There are better foods at this price point."

I expected beef or carrots no it is ground yellow corn meal, chicken by product meal, corn glutton, whole wheat flour animal fat, rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol meat and bone meal.Then tons of chemical additives, some dried corn and carrots. This is a semi soft food dogs love, no wonder just like people what tastes so good is usually bad for us.

The carbonation works well with the 100 percent fruit juice blend.

16834,B001LGGH40,5.0,"The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink...

253185,B001EQ4IES,2.0,"I was hoping to find an instant coffee that was as good as Starbucks Via without forking over the very high cost involved. I decided on this one and was thrilled when I read all the positive reviews here on Amazon. The first time I made it, I'd done it too strong, but eventually I found the proper strength. Unfortunately, the coffee never tasted good,and I'm shocked that anyone likes it.<br /><br />I understand that an instant coffee generally can't hold up to a fresh-brewed coffee, but this stuff isn't even close. When making it, the aroma comes across less like fresh coffee and more like a well-burnt piece of bacon. It also doesn't look exactly like coffee, with a hue that reminded me more of Diet Coke than fresh coffee.<br /><br />I don't normally drink my coffee black, preferring some flavored liquid creamer, but I do taste it before adding flavor to ensure it's the right strength, that the foundation of my morning drink is good. This stuff is extremely bitter, and that burned taste overwhelms any subtle flavors that may lie beneath. I've tried making it weaker, adding more creamer, and everything else I can think of. It's just not very good. If I were desparate, I might drink it, but just looking at it, those burnt, acrid memories come back, and I'd rather stop at a coffee shop, or grab some Starbucks Via, if I didn't have any way to make my own drip-brew.<br /><br />I read these other reviews, and I'm just baffled. This stuff barely qualifies as coffee, and as premium instant, it's a joke. I went back to making my own coffee instead of plunging further into the wilderness that is instant. And a 7 oz. canister of Taster's Choice French Roast just sits in the cupboard, with 80% of its contents remaining, waiting for the day when I just sigh and toss it into the trash."

I was also giving a spoonful to my 4 year old daughter.  When I saw my daughter start acting dumb, it confirmed that my lethargy wasn't accidental.  I quickly stopped giving her and myself any coconut oil to eat.  I don't exercise enough but my daughter runs around like a top all the time.  She gets plenty of exercise and this seemed to slow her mental abilities regardless of exercise.  My chest constrictions have gone after two weeks without coconut oil.  We only use it to moisterize dry skin.<br /><br />Right after I doubted the effects of this product on cholesterol, I did a more thorough internet search and discovered that blood types O did not do well with coconut oil and it is best to avoid it.  Guess what.  One third the population in America, including my family, has blood type O.<br /><br />So coconut oil may help - if you don't have blood type O."

75678,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"The No Fear energy supplement is pretty much a standard energy drink, much like Monster, Venom, and the others. The flavor itself is one that you have to get used to, just like many of the other ones of this style. It's not terrible (doesn't taste like medicine) but it's not fruit punch either. I reacted to this the way I typically react to energy drinks so I'll describe it in general terms. I am the type who is sensitive to caffeine and herbal energy blends. As such, a can like this is one I will nurse throughout the day. You need to know your limits. Some people can pound them like a bottle of beer at a party. I am not one of them. If I drink this stuff too fast it drives my heart rate up and makes me bounce off the walls, then I'm burned out when it wears off. Sipped slowly throughout the day, I don't have a problem and I can sustain the ""wake-up"" all day and into the evening.<br /><br />Again, be aware, too much of this stuff can be harmful. If you have anxiety problems and you pound this, it can make matters worse. Same with high blood pressure or any of that. Also, this particular one is not sugar free, so you're talking added calories. If you're watching your carb intake or your weight, go for one of the sugar free ones."
79335,B003TNANSO,4.0,"Tastes great and satisfies my hunger. I am currently on a fitness diet and I don't feel guilty when I am eating one of these.  Since there are no ""melty"" ingredients, it stays in tact in hot cars, at beaches etc which is an added bonus.  I took a star off because the calorie count is a bit high, but I chalk that up to the great taste and the fact that it fills you up."
125138,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"I finally, FINALLY found a dark chocolate that I love... Only to have it swept off the shelves and replaced with a disgusting 'new recipe' that reminded me of chocolate I bought on sale at a dollar store once. One of the other reviewers said 'waxy and tasteless' and that about sums it up. Plus, I find it insulting that they would trumpet NEW RECIPE!! on the box, and expect the consumer to assume that it was improved, as opposed to ruined.<br /><br />Lindt-- Charge more, I don't care, but don't sacrifice the quality of your products. Americans are SICK TO DEATH of soy products in EVERYTHING."
80653,B0052BRVU4,4.0,"I've wanted to try Gevalia for a while, but I haven't had the opportunity until recently, when I found it at a local Meijer. The coffee itself is mellow, not pungent like most espresso, but it still packs a decent kick. I definitely prefer it to the other locally available brands that are already ground (Bustelo and company.) My only complaints are that the ground seems a little coarse for espresso (although you wouldn't know it after brewing, the crema is excellent!), and that there isn't a whole bean version, which would be a very nice addition for espresso lovers. I also think that the Amazon page for this product could use a little more flair, it's a bit uninformative!"
17581,B0000GH6UQ,5.0,I love this hot chocolate  !  this is just a great drink -- the first couple times I made it I didn't do it correctly and it didn't so good --  You have to nuke the bar of chocolate for 30 seconds in microwave  - and you have to put in blender -- so all ingredients blend  -- if you don't you will have a chalky and that would be sad  --  what I have learned is  put chocolate in microwave --  put your milk in sauce pan and warm it up  -- add chocolate and stir  --  when the chocolate melts put into a blender or I use immersion blender to get all spices blended  --  yeah and then you have the best hot chocolate in the world --  how can you go wrong with big beautiful piece of chocolate ?  all other hot chocolate drinks are kind of boring compared to this  --
129433,B001FA1EHC,1.0,"As a lover of 70% dark chocolate, who is happy with grocery store Lindt--I hoped, but alas--once again, just say no to Hershey's. This is just a step up from the ubiquitous normal silver covered kisses--and not much of a step up."
17972,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"If you love peanut butter but hate the fat and sugar, then this product is for you. It is fantastic in smoothies and shakes--has a real peanut butter taste. At 45 calories a serving, I have it almost every day with my Shakeology! I will always keep this in the house."
82564,B000OMMYNK,4.0,"Is this really ceremony grade and organic? I don't think I should be the critic b/c I probably couldn't tell. I order items online all the time, but I wonder if this is the real deal. I drink it mostly for the health benefits and can't really tell if it's worth the money. The company website looks amateur and makes me question this product. However, it does taste good. Better when first brewed hot (not boiling) and then refrigerated or added to other cold foods/drinks."
125120,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"I enjoyed Lindt Excellence 70% as a lunch treat for over ten years. It was a real favorite of mine, and I trusted a company like Lindt to not mess with a 165-year tradition. I was wrong. Lindt seems to be pursuing Hershey (or worse) now, instead of keeping a proud tradition alive. (The recipe has, by the way, only changed for the US market.)<br /><br />Lindt is still calling this Excellence 70% Cocoa (although the tag at the bottom does say ""Smooth Dark"" instead of ""Intense Dark""). But it is a (literally) pale reflection of the original recipe, and an insult to the Lindt tradition. At least when Coca Cola screwed up, it had changed the name to New Coke so it could easily bring back Classic Coke. Lindt is now stuck, by drastically changing the recipe but not changing the name. Those who liked the old recipe have abandoned them with this change, and are not likely to trust them again, and those who like the new recipe will react the same if they change it back. I think this one will be studied in biz schools as a ""how not to do it"" case."
17885,B001EO653M,5.0,This is the best drinking chocolate I have had on the market.  The spices are perfectly combined for an authentic Mexican taste. The seller delivered 100% as promised.<br />Thank you.
246996,B0002HDM06,2.0,"I just spent time in Greece last month, one of many places I visited along the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea.  I was also in the Middle East (Israel).  And I can tell you, this does NOT even compare to the real stuff.<br /><br />This Baklava is very, very dry and very conservative on the quantity and quality of ingredients.  It lacks flavor big time!  And the pieces are so small they are bite size.  The nuts are minced so fine you can't even tell they are nuts.  Instead it's like a dry, pasty filling with little flavor.<br /><br />In Greece, the pieces are large (huge compared to what you get with this), overflowing with the moist, nutty filling, very flavorful, with lots of honey, spices, and phyllo.  I had Baklava purchased at a bakery on Patmos Island, Greece that blows this Baklava out of the water by far.<br /><br />I won't be buying from here again.  I'll keep looking elsewhere.<br /><br />I gave two stars for packaging and speed.  If I only had to rate the product itself, it would've gotten zero stars."

17399,B001ELL6ZC,5.0,"This is a really good waffle mix! It's great for a large family or group meals. If there's just two people one batch makes only 3 waffles, which was a little odd the first time we made waffles with this mix because it was an uneven amount.

81752,B005CUU25G,4.0,"I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)"
133556,B000GZW9PI,1.0,"I love restaurant quality Thai. *Love it.* I made this stuff and almost gagged at the smell. It smells like what I would expect boiled dry dog food to smell like. We made it with chicken and I was determined to try to gag it down to not waste the chicken. I couldn't do it. I tried putting Thai sauce on it, soy sauce on it - anything. Nothing could hide the smell and stale musty flavor.<br /><br />Save your money and your senses and avoid!"
167341,B007PE7ANY,3.0,I thought it was coming free but it was sent in a oversized box which cost me 5 bucks at the ups store. The bar tasted good
152838,B000F0G72U,3.0,"This rice had a definite earthy flavor, but it also had a slightly musty undertone, and a slight bitterness. I rinsed it well before cooking.  The color was nowhere near ruby, but it was more of a medium dark brown with a reddish or slightly purple blush.  I'll eat it, but I won't buy it again. It's too expensive and not special enough to justify the cost.  I much prefer Lotus Foods Forbidden rice."
79401,B003TNANSO,4.0,"I like this bar.  It does have an initial interesting taste, but I'm sure it's the mac nuts in it.  I would buy it again.  It is VERY moist and sticky - which is good cause it won't dry out your mouth like a lot of bars do.  I think I'd like to try other flavors as well.  I let a co-worker try it and she said, ""it tastes like lip gloss"".  I'm not sure how she got that opinion, but thought I'd put that in my review.  It is different from any other bar that I've eaten; sesame seeds, mac nuts, etc."
159597,B000FWAWVA,3.0,"This so called ""No Calorie Sweetener"" does indeed have calories!  According to the Splenda website, one cup of Splenda has 96 calories and 24 grams of carbohydrates.<br /><br />If you want a sweetener for baking, use a liquid Sucralose sweetener."
150605,B000VVP2LK,3.0,I bought these for my pitbull puppy since he feels the need to chew everything in sight. These are not as thick/strong as regular bully sticks so he can go through one in about 5 minutes. On the plus side they dont smell awful so I guess its kind of a trade off. Not bad for the price.
76194,B000E1DREG,4.0,It was nice to buy a product that is difficult to buy in our area and at a good price.  We truly enjoy the Kraft Raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing.  It was a great purchase for our family.
16558,B000FNADD6,5.0,"Very very good oatmeal. I bought this because I couldn't find the Apple cinnamon Kashi at my local store and thought maybe this would taste good even though it doesn't have anything in it (Amazon says it has raisins in the description, no it doesn't.). Anyways this oatmeal is very good, it's not overly sweet at all like Quakers oatmeal, but it's still sweet and not bland. I add my OWN raisins to this to get some extra texture in there and it works out great. It's way better than the apple cinnamon kind."
17965,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,I love the product. It really taste awesome on toast. I am thrilled it is all natural. I brought some to school and had all the teachers try this for lunch in the teachers room. It was a huge hit.
157082,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"I recieved both this and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3CG"">Melitta Cafe Collection Blanc et Noir Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> to try - while I LOVED the Blanc et Noir, I found the flavor of this one to only be so-so.  Still it's better then the free stuff I get at work - I would buy the Blanc et Noir before purchasing this flavor.  Maybe I just don't care for Hazlenut or something.  There wasn't anything wrong with it, and I'm sure there will be many who adore this coffee.  I simply preferred the other flavor.  The coffee is pre-ground and very fine, almost (but not quite) to the level of espresso.  Now even though I preferred the other flavor, this was good enough for me to finish the whole bag no problem.  Several of my friends actually preferred this to the other.<br /><br />The packaging however - remains the same - you need to find a greek god to simply pull the package open or you need to go at it with a pair of scissors.  True, you don't have to worry about any of the grounds escaping before you open it... but trust me, just use the scissors.<br /><br />Final opinion - 3 for the flavor 2 for the packaging.  I am sure there are many who will consider this a 5 star coffee and you may well be one of them.  If you like Hazelnut then this is probably right up your alley as the hazelnut overpowers the creme brulee flavoring."
17871,B001EO653M,5.0,"The first time I tasted this Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate was in a restaurant in Southern Colorado. It was a cool rainy day and I was in love with it after the first sip.I have never tasted anything this good. I took down the name of the product, googled it, and quickly ordered it from Amazon. I will now be ready for the first snowy day in Denver. It is the best hot chocolate mix ever!!!"

It's not even an OK variety.  It is quite bitter, and yet the matcha flavor is very weak - how do they manage that?  Another Amazon variety (sold by NP Trading, and by Vita Life?) is better.  I only use 1 tsp of that but I need to use 2 tsp of this and it still isn't as good.  I think I might throw away the rest of the giant package that I own.  :("

If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.<br /><br />The Switch has five different flavors in eight-ounce cans.  The Black Cherry is a combination of apple, grape, cherry, and acerola juices.  Acerola is a fruit high in vitamin C and antioxidants.  The Black Cherry flavor is sweet without being too sweet and very fruity.  If you enjoy fruity beverages, you will love The Switch Black Cherry.<br /><br />I only wish the can were bigger!"

She eats the canned food and bits of meat, but leaves most of the kibble behind.  Since I feared the problem was that she was getting used to the canned food/meat, I tried feeding her just this kibble for a few days.<br /><br />I had an unhappy (and hungry!) dog.<br /><br />From the human point of view, it looks fine and smells fine.  No weird aromas or anything.  But she just won't eat it.<br /><br />I wish I had something more positive to say, but this one is now in the pantry to be used for emergency.

I don't care if the glucose is organic or not - it's CORN SYRUP! Addictive, cheap, non-nutritious corn syrup. The fourth ingredient, no less. In addition, the DHA/ARA is derived from a process that involves Hexane - a possible neurotoxin. Earth's Best claims that testing shows no traces of Hexane in the formula but that is not good enough for me or my baby. Why bother adding an ingredient that requires a process that uses poison when there are other alternatives? Not a good call, Earth's Best 'organic'. I am switching to Organic 'Baby's Only' formula."

I then tried it in a smaller cup with the same results, barely any taste to it. I then tried it in a tiny 6 oz tea cup and it still really had no flavor other then a slight taste of cinnamon in hot water. Very weak tea with awful side effects of extreme nausea. Not sure if this was from the acid in it or something else, maybe the cinnamon. I can't recommend this on any level, it is weak and tasteless with awful side effects at least for me.  I love plain Rooibos and I will stick to that."

If you buy several at once (because free shipping is at the $60 level) 11th Street Coffee is a couple of bucks cheaper.  Coupon codes are also easy to find for them.

79228,B003TNANSO,4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised that this bar actually tasted like a handful of fresh nuts & fruit. Usually snack, protein or energy bars taste chemically. Not this one. It would be a convenient food to take to eat on-the-go. But, be warned. It's a bit on the sticky side (and I didn't carry it in the sun or in a car...). So either bring along a moist towelette or use a squirt of those towel free hand sanitizers to eliminate sticky finger syndrome. I'd suggest not eating this particular bar while driving because of that. The calories were not too high for this class of food product (190) and the sodium wasn't obnoxious (20mg - I've seen worse), but I wish they'd get the sugars to under 9g (they're 12g). While I wouldn't eat these bars every day, for nutritional & calorie reasons, it's a brand I'll keep on hand for quick emergency hunger fixes."

I had previously been using the Baronet Espresso roast pods, which are 'ESE' pods.  Packaging and description on both products simply state 'coffee pods'.  It would be a better benefit to consumers if manufacturers could at least properly identify their own product so we can make informed purchasing decisions.<br /><br />If you need senseo style coffee pods, these might be a choice for you.  If you need ESE coffee pods, stay away.<br /><br />'Senso' style coffee pods are large, loosely filled, and about 70mm in diameter.<br />'ESE' style coffee pods are smaller, tightly packed, and about 52-55mm in diameter."

246024,B001G604ZI,2.0,Don't care for this product. It is thick and creamy and has no coffee flavor at all so you have to add espresso to get any flavor out of it.
76768,B0049ULB78,4.0,This coffee has made me forget Starbucks. It tastes a lot like the grande lattes I had been drinking. I'm using it in the Platinum Keurig and making the largest cup size (travel mug size.) Wonderful.
155237,B000GAT6NG,3.0,"This a pretty good oil. Tastes good, nice texture, smells fresh. I've just experienced superior coconut by other brands. I like nutiva though, they carry quality products, so im not dissapointed, just not blown away. I'd probably re purchase eventually."

16780,B001LGGH40,5.0,"Switch Kiwi Berry is the perfect blend of tangy, tart, and sweet, with a delicious dose of kiwi flavor and subdued berry taste.<br /><br />This drink is bubbly, but better than a soda because:  1 - it is clean, not sticky, 2 - it is 100% fruit juice, 3 - there is no added sugar, 4 - there is no added anything else that is bad.<br /><br />This is a healthy drink, but it could trick us into believing it is bad.  I have only good things to say about Switch drinks, and can't think of one bad thing about it.<br /><br />This drink would be a perfect substitute for soda with whatever you would normally drink soda with, such as:  sandwich and chips, pizza, tacos, grapes and cheese and crackers, nachos."
123692,B0029NMM34,1.0,"I had previously purchased this Pedigree chicken dog food for my finicky 1-year-old german shepherd and she loved it.  When my shipment arrived from Amazon I immediately opened a can from the end of the plastic-encased 24-pack and presented it to my dog.  She sniffed it and refused it, so I left it out for her. She kept begging for food, but I would each time point out that she had food in her dish.  She finally ate it, reluctantly, the next evening and then was up all night vomiting. The next day we smelled a dead animal odor that we couldn't locate. Sugar (the dog) sniffed it out for us at the top of the cabinet and we discovered that at least one of the Pedigree cans had burst open and was full of squirming white worms and rotting, oozing liquid that permeated the entire package. I felt so guilty for making Sugar eat something that made her sick, and threw away the entire package. Now I'm afraid to buy the brand again."

125589,B0029NJ16K,1.0,Four times I have put out this product for my dag and each time he smells it and then walks away. I just gave the unused food to my friends German Shepherd. Maybe my dog is just too finicky.
123768,B0000E6GZR,1.0,It certainly didin't taste a thing like the chokecherry jelly I had growing up in N.Dak.  No tanginess.  I don't thingk there was any real chokecherry juice used. I was very disappointed as I got one for me and one for a Christmas gift for my brother.

253495,B004JRMG98,2.0,"As a huge Taco Bell fan, I was pumped to try their new line of sauces, but I've been underwhelmed. The Jalapeno Sauce has a nice Peppery kick, but the flavor was really lacking. I found myself leaving the bottle untouched on Taco night, which surprised me. So far, I'm having to content myself with using little packets of Fire Sauce left over from my Taco Bell visits."
130128,B0078ETZXE,1.0,"I purchased the Gia Russa Alla Vodka, and when I opened it I found moldy and rotten tomato chunks in the sauce and had to throw the entire jar away. I emailed the company and asked for a refund. A couple weeks later I received a $1 off coupon in the mail. I sent a second email again requesting a refund, and never received a reply. This product is very expensive compared to other pasta sauces and as a result I expected the manufacturer to have a high level of quality control and customer service. It appears they have neither. Moldy/rotten product plus very bad customer service to not send a refund. I will never purchase this product again."
163772,B000HENGXM,3.0,"I bought these licorice wheels online after I failed to find them in local stores. I intended to use them to make the legs of brownie-bite spiders for a Halloween party. When the wheels arrived, however, they had become sticky/gummy during shipping. I was unable to cut and separate pieces of the wheels to decorate my baked goods.<br /><br />This product is good. The seller is good. But this product does not withstand shipping well. But locally if at all possible."
152233,B004OVATO8,3.0,"Ouch is what my poor gums would say after eating this bar. Pure  Natural Bars, Superfruit Nutty Crunch is just too hard. If you enjoy eating these types of hard bars that are on the sweeter side, then you may enjoy this.<br /><br />Pros: natural bar is gluten free, vegan, kosher, natural ingredients (the only reasons I have it 3 stars)<br /><br />Cons: too hard & sticky, there's too much sugar in it (or evaporated cane sugar) 12 grams of sugar is not a good trade off for only 5 grams of protein, it should be the opposite.<br /><br />I wouldn't want my young child eating this, unless I plan on brushing his teeth right afterwards and checking on his little gums to make sure they have not been irritated."

149608,B000E8WIAS,3.0,"I've used liquid stevia for over 5 years and have used 2 brands. I like the Sweet Leaf brand the most and have had the most experience with that brand.  When Sweet Leaf liquid stevia is new, it is a perfectly clear liquid.  Although I'm not sure why, when it ages, it turns a caramely brown color although it retains its taste and effectivness.  I purchased the Vanilla Creme (my favorite in plain Greek yogurt) on Amazon to save time in running to our health food store 40 minutes away.  The transaction was great and shipping was fast.  However, when I opened them, they were already caramely brown, which indicates to me that their stock is old, which is why I gave the review only 3 stars.  Although everything else was just fine, I think I will stick to getting it from my health food store to ensure the highest freshness (because it lasts such a long time anyway)."
164839,B00456RNTQ,3.0,"The apple flavored candy is pretty weak and low quality. My initial reaction was to instead break up the candy bar into several servings due to the quality of the candy. The ants in the candy were neat and interesting, with a smokey flavor not very much unlike that of chewing on popcorn kernels. Would definitely try other ant-based products!"
136346,B006Q820X0,1.0,I preordered this product and have been very disapointed in it. Almost every time that I brew this in my Keurig brewer there are grounds in my coffee. Sometimes the bottom doesn't punture and the k-cup flows over and at other times it does but there are still grounds. I have had to brew two cups usually to get one cup of coffee. My other brands don't have this problem. I gave it one star because when I do get a decent cup it tastes OK.
125585,B000P3T4HW,1.0,"I'm always on the look out for low calorie/low point/healthy alternatives to foods that I like. However, this food was a big disappointment. It honestly tastes like nail polish. I saw a review saying that on another website and thought: how is that possible? How can anyone sell a product that tastes like nail polish? But IT DOES! I purchased this at a Super Target for around $4. I, unfortunately, had to throw it away. I think I'll stick to reduced fat or sugar free peanut butter."
127894,B005R7QGUE,1.0,"Wow, I wondered why I needed ten times as much mint to achieve the same about of flavor.  Then I took a closer look at the label.  I wish I had been more careful before purchasing Watkins.  The name of the product says 'Watkins Pure Mint Extract', but the fine print is much more honest.<br /><br />Read the fine details before you buy.  I wish I had.  After a lot of searching, I came across nowfoods.com.  They have food grade 100% Pure Peppermint oil and Spearmint oil, with NO alcohol.  I'm sure there are others, but this is the first one I found."

The packaging/resealable function is great as well. However, the poor ingredients are just not worth it to me. If you go on the Beneful site, you'll see claims of ""Protein-rich nutrition, with real beef"". However, look closer at the ingredients and you'll see that they start with: ""ground yellow corn, chicken-by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat, rice flour"", etc. BEEF does not actually enter the picture until ingredient #7..."

I love to drink soda and when I go to the store I can never find any without high fructose corn syrup. These switch sodas are very easy drinking but contain NO HFCS! For that reason alone I give this a 5 star. The can size is kind of small compared to what we Americans are used to drinking 16 oz soda is the standard size here in the US. These are 1/2 that size and a quick swig can knock it out.<br /><br />The kiwi-strawberry flavor is very yummy.

78357,B00064VQO4,4.0,"I like this olive oil because it has a distinct grassy taste, but it's not as good as the best Tuscan ones like the Badia A Coltibuono ones especially the Campo Corto <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058DL846"">Campo Corto 100% Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil 16.9 oz by Badia a Colitbuono</a>, or Marfuga that you can buy from Williams Sonoma.<br /><br />I enjoyed Bariani's distinctive olive taste which is superior to most good olive oils that you can get for $20 at the supermarket, so I don't think Bariani is that bad but I agree with other reviewers that its aftertaste is bitter rather than peppery. I don't mind the bitterness because I think it adds character but I also like them peppery and this one is not peppery enough."

It is a bit fizzy when mixed and the particles didn't completely dissolve so the drink was like a sweet, fruity seltzery antiacid drink. It is a good way to get some vitamins, but don't expect a quick lift of energy to accomplish some physical activity."
124755,B0045X7H9A,1.0,Did not work. Did not give me any extra energy. Taste was alright and that is why I gave the one star.
77027,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I love granola...in both bar and crumbled form.  So I jumped at the chance to try this Chocolate Delight Granola.  Long story short, it tastes great.  If you like chocolate and granola, you'll like this (that isn't really saying much is it).<br /><br />However, my major problem with granola of any kind is that it isn't particularly healthy.  Don't get me wrong...it isn't like going out and eating some lard enriched southern breakfast.  But it isn't very low on the calories either.  A single serving of this stuff is about 200 calories...and there are 8 servings per bag.  I don't know about any of you, but 1.5 ounces of tasty granola isn't going to be enough for me :)...especially since it comes in large pouch form.  Suffice it to say that this bag lasted me two morning drives to work...and 800 calories a morning is just a bit too much for me :/"

There are two servings in one can. I only drank one serving at a time. I could not detect any extra energy or alertness. I am a coffee drinker though. It does have caffeine in it, but not an excessive amount. Probably just the right amount so it doesn't give one the jitters. I liked it."

241641,B0081XPTBS,2.0,"I should start by saying I only give my baby 4-8 oz of formula a day, otherwise she's breastfed, so the issues I have with this product minimally effect us.<br /><br />It is important to me to give my baby organic food whenever possible, so that is the main reason I picked this product to begin with, also when I purchased the price was better than other organic formulas and it doesn't have corn syrup in it.<br /><br />The downsides:<br /><br />It is difficult to mix, you must use warm/hot water in order to get the lumps out.  And it gets ridiculously frothy when shaken up, like the entire bottle is foam.  What I do now is make a bottle at least a few hours ahead of time and stick it in the fridge, by the time I need to use it, the air bubbles are gone.<br /><br />My baby is not a picky eater at all, so I can't comment on the taste of it.<br /><br />Update:  My baby is now 7 months and takes about 16-18 oz of formula a day.  We noticed that she had been spitting up a lot since increasing her feedings, she would spit up without fail after a feeding, not matter how well she was burped and she would spit up again, sometimes 3 more times in the next hour.  When I happened to run out of this brand and had to use some similac, the spitting up nearly disappeared.  If I had to guess it's due to all the foam in the bottle, but perhaps it's one of the ingredients?  As I mentioned in the above review, the amount of shaking that has to be done to dissolve the formula is ridiculous.  Even with very warm water and a lot of shaking we'll have lumps of undissolved formula in the bottom of the bottle.  I am very disappointed because the price is right and it's one of only 2 options of organic formula that isn't full of arsenic.  Unfortunately a new shipment of 4 of these canisters arrived after realizing this, so we're stuck with it.  But I think I will mix it with another formula to minimize the spitting up."

The cookies tasted a bit stale and were incredibly hard, although I am not sure if they were  overbaked, old or somehthing else.  Although they are organic the cookies left a funny aftertaste and I was incredibly thirsty after eating a few of these. I don't recommend these snaps and would rate them as mediocre."

155452,B000GAT6NG,3.0,"I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable.  Also, coconut ""oil"" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated.  Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve.  I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up."

17752,B000Z978SS,5.0,"I like this product because it tastes just like sugar.  It is non-clumping so it flows very freely.  It doesn't attract water like sugar does so it stays dry even in very humid air.  Some have said that it has a cooling effect like xylitol, which is sometimes undesirable, but if it does, it is very mild to the point that I was not able to perceive it.  To my taste, it is about a half as sweet as sugar so it takes more but I've detected no digestive upset whatsoever, which is not true for many other sugar substitutes."
163070,B0001CXUH2,3.0,"I have used the Honeyville brand over the last two years.  As a professional baker it matters a lot to me that the egg whites whip up high.  These do not whip as high.  Also, I discovered that it takes 3tsp of this product compared with 2tsp of the other to mix with 1 T of water to equal one white.  That makes this product more expensive than I had thought."
243435,B00305L330,2.0,"I really wanted to like this one-stop-shop for my morning run out the door. However, the taste is getting in the way. I prefer making a similar mixture with a packet of Instant Breakfast mix (no sugar), a half packet of Via (your choice of brew) and a half scoop of premium Chocolate or Vanilla Whey protein powder. You end up with something better tasting, higher in protein and lighter on the e-wallet."

I will stick to a chocolate bar to satisfy my gluten-free chocolate cravings after these are gone.<br />If you plan to buy these, you may want to know that there are 9 cookies in each box. All of mine arrived broken and crumbled (not sure why since no previous problems with having food shipped to me by Amazon) but still taste good."

I put some in my yogurt and a smile came across my face:)  I didn't read the nutrition label before ordering some for myself but not sure if that would have changed my mind.  It's high in calories - fat and carbs, especially for only a 1/2 cup serving.  However, protein and fiber is a positive for me.  I love the flavor and crunch."

We have now made a switch to the Blastin' Berry Cherry.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste."

Just the gooey cream with a hint of the chocolate so if you're a chocolate lover, this won't help you much.  The spongecake is still the same, however, and very fresh.  It's worth trying, especially if you're frying them but as a lunchbox snack, I'd pass."

This is going to make a wonderful brew in the mornings. A definite improvement over what I was drinking, and I was drinking some pretty good stuff, and certainly a lot cheaper than Starbucks! I would put this on par with the Starbucks, and they have just raised their prices again. This is where I will be buying my coffee from now on."

I hate to leave a bad review given they were so conscientious about following up, but I have concerns about how safe their eggs are even if not completely putrid. I recommend them for their coconut products -- just not their eggs."

When I opened the box, there was loose coffee all over the place, and the lids look like someone sat in front of their tv and glued them on by hand. So ok, I could probably have lived with that, but when I brewed it, it was terrible--nothing like any of the others on the market. It just tasted like old stale coffee.  I tried to return it, and it's not returnable.  If you want to try an ""off-brand"" of K cup, try the San Franscisco Fog Chaser--it's not actually a K cup but fits into the Keurig and the coffee is good.  As far as the Brooklyn one, fuggetaboutit!"
77851,B001LG940E,4.0,Switch Black Cherry has a nice Black Cherry cider type flavor with a bit of carbonation.  The drink is naturally sweet and has no discernable after-taste.  The product comes in a rather small poptop can (and I only recieved one can) so I went for it straight in a glass and couldn't see how it stood up to ice.  I gave the main-squeeze a couple of sips too - she liked it and gave it a two-thumbs up.<br /><br />It was a bit milder tasting than IBC Black Cherry Soda but not unpleasantly so.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I prefer Stewarts Cherries and Cream (a 5 star beverage if there ever was one).<br /><br />If the price on this is right - I'd probably buy it if Stewrts or IBC wasn't available.
82265,B004VDGX30,4.0,"This is a strong, quality mate.  The mint flavor is faint, perhaps due to the use of spearmint instead of stronger peppermint (a personal preference).  Yet it's just enough to add a pleasant, cooling effect to the mate bitterness and earthiness."
157096,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"First off, it had a strange scent when I opened the bag.  Something fake, but not even dessert like.  More like a Yankee Candle, wax and all.  I decided to try it anyway.  I was very careful with the brew, since I have read other reviews. I got it to only have a slightly bitter aftertaste by stopping brewing a few minutes early.  I am thinking the fine grade makes it hard to brew, where whole beans would be better.  After weighing it down a bit with sugar and milk, it's ok.  Not horrible, not great, ok.  I've heard good things about this company, but wouldn't buy any other coffees from them if they are like this."

This thing has nothing to do with real Dukkah, not the taste, nor the color or the texture, and the portions are very small for this high price. I threw most of it to the trash. Sorry to be that harsh but this review accurately reflects my experience."
156170,B0028H1GC4,3.0,"I have been drinking a ton of tea lately and have been trying a few different products on Amazon.  I found this Twining's tea to have a very nice berry flavor that doesn't taste artificial at all, but I prefer a stronger tea flavor.  In this cold brew,  the berry def. tastes stronger than the tea.  I feel like flavored iced tea should taste like tea with a flavor, and to me this tastes the opposite.  I am going to experiment with letting it steep longer, and maybe trying a hot brew.  But as is, it's just too weak for my tastes.<br /><br />As I mentioned,  I have been trying different iced teas.  I find China Mist iced teas to be far superior to this,  but shipping is expensive (and you have to order a lot to qualify for free shipping)."

I tried many that claim to be low-acid or for sensitive stomach but i still felt the discomfort after drinking them.  But not this one!  I'm so glad that i found this.  I actually bought this at a local Asian supermarket for under $6.  The taste is nice and smooth...although i can imagine it being not strong enough for people who like their coffee strong."

253622,B001E534MG,2.0,Be careful when you order this particular package. It contains only 23.2-ounce tubs. Even with free shipping and no tax the price per ounce is much higher than your local wholesale club. I mention this because the product first came out in these tubs at the wholesale clubs and looks the same as this package. The wholesale club tubs are 34-ounces.<br /><br />I'm annoyed by this because I don't usually price or value shop Amazon products. I operate on the assumption that Amazon offers the best value in general. If there is a small difference in price it's usually made up in free Prime shipping or tax. So beware on these grocery type items.

I tried the Fruit Grove Nuggets which left me with an overwhelming flavor of banana. Next I tried the Orchard Sours, I love sour candy, and hoped this would taste better. This flavor left me with a strong taste of lemon rind in my mouth. Lastly I tried the Berrilicious Nuggets hoping I didn't waste all my money on these. The Berrilicious left me with the flavor of blueberry as an aftertaste. This wasn't so bad compared to the others. I will eat the Berrilicious, but not the others. I, personally, will not buy these again."

18036,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"Woah...wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is, honestly. When mixed with water, the consistency is a dead ringer for regular peanut butter and the taste is spot on. I was expecting bland, chalky paste but it definitely is nothing like that. MMM! So good! Excited to try it in/on everything!! If you're on the fence, just give it a try. For way under $10, and way under the regular fat content of regular peanut butter, this stuff is a god-send!"
150877,B000EVSYI0,3.0,"These candies were not bad and I will probably buy again, but I was disappointed.  They are very chewy (almost tough) and just taste like an inexpensive candy.  Ironically, in the same order, I also purchased the black licorice wheels (also by Haribo) packaged in the smaller bags.  In contrast, the black licorice wheels were very fresh, moist and tasty.  I think whether or not a person likes the red wheels simply depends upon their individual taste.  If the red ones presented like the black ones (moist, fresh and very tasty), I would be very pleased.  Perhaps it would be helpful to describe the red ones as an ""ordinary"" and the black ones as ""gormet."""

It's not a bad product by any means, but probably not something I'll be buying often - just more of a fun treat every so often."

We also had it set up to deliver automatically every 3 months so we do not run out! This method also saves you an additional 15%!  Buy this tea off amazon and save 50% over in store prices!
149128,B000H7F78G,3.0,its nice to have them individually wrapped. the taste is ok but a little chemical taste in the parts without chocolate chunks. each individual would have to try for themselves. they will keep easily due to individual wrapping.
76971,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"The back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola was better tasting than I had expected. The dark chocolate is delicious and the granola is good tasting too. It is a bit difficult to eat out of the bag because it is broken up fairly small. This is a good thing for younger kids, but as an adult I would like bigger clumps. It is a bit on the dry side, but what granola product isn't. There seems to be a nice mix of the granola to chocolate. I found a couple of large clumps of chocolate and claimed them as mine before anybody else in the house could get them. ;) It makes a nice, quick, snack. It would be nice to take on the go, but I wouldn't take it along if it was too warm because the chocolate would probably melt and make a mess. My 10 year old came along and grabbed a handful and a few minutes later came back and asked if they could have some more, so this passes the kid test with me."
157074,B002TMV3GC,3.0,When you first open this bag of coffee you are met with a wonderful hazelnut aroma with a slight hint of caramel. Upon brewing my first cup I noticed that the aroma intensified a bit and had more of a coffee overtone and less of the previous hazelnut and caramel..  Unfortunately the taste was a bit strong and bitter.  It was almost like having strong dark bitter coffee with some hazelnut coffeemate to tone it down.  The second cup was made by brewing a bit lighter and the taste became much more smooth and pleasant.  There is still a slightly bitter undertone but a little bit of milk smooths things out very nicely.  Overall this is a strong and bitter coffee with a hazelnut flavor so make sure this suits your taste or you like your coffee with dash of milk.<br /><br />*** Positive Points: ***<br /><br />- Great hazelnut aroma<br />- Pleasant taste once adjusted for bitterness<br /><br />*** Negative Points: ***<br /><br />- Strong and somewhat bitter taste<br />- Rather expensive

If this is all you have tried, you will like it, but the Plain Chocolate variety is so much better.  The chocolate coating is not bitter (as some dark chocolate varieties can be)- it is still sweet, but the chocolate flavor is stronger and contrasts with the cookie much better.  This Milk Chocolate variety can be found at World Market."
77434,B005ZSN49Q,4.0,"This is a single 16.9oz bottle of first press extra virgin olive oil.  Mine arrived with one of those olive oil dispenser nozzles like you see at salad bars.  I am not planning to use it every day, so I pour from the bottle, which drips a little without having one of those internal dripless plastic inserts.  The flavor is great.  The aroma is fairly mild.  I probably won't buy again as it is $23 for 33 tablespoons of olive oil, a little out of my comfort range for how much to spend on food items for me.  But it was nice to try, and many people rave about this olive oil."

The powder mixes with a little water and spreads on bread or whatever way you like to eat peanut butter. Anyone on Weight Watchers or any weight loss program should try this product. It is just ground peanuts with the fat removed!

I dont drink much coffee but tried this at the hotel I was staying and found the taste to be a great satisfying morning drink. I brought some home and plan to introduce my employees to this quick and easy idea for those who have to have coffee in the mornings or throughout the day. Quick and easy and satisfying.

Absolutely the worst smoked salmon I have ever had so far, what a waste of $30+ dollar (16oz) and a piece of salmon!<br /><br />On a side note, I also got 5 different flavoured 4oz ""Echo Falls"" smoked salmon, all tasted excellent, and pricewise, 4 pack of 4oz ""Echo Falls"" salmon is equal to 16oz but cost less than $30, will never buy the ""Seabear"" brand."

I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle.

Looking back at the package I realized that the photographer had placed full sized peanuts in the photo to make it LOOK like they were part of the bar.  Old time deceptive advertising.

Probably less than a 16th of the two serving bottle.  Very soon I was tweaking quite extremely and my friend noticed how irritable I had become from the drink.  However, it did seem to wear off a few hours later without a crash.  I gave it a tentative try the next day, only drinking a tiny sip twice during the day.  Similar effect, so far so good.  The third day I tried a tiny sip in the morning and developed an excruciating headache and nausea that has lasted for two days now.  I feel extremely overwired and unable to come down from it.  Very very sick.  I feel horrible still two days later and I hope I improve soon."

It is far less than quality. Would anyone give arsenic to their dog, absolutely not. So don't spend your money on this killer product.

I purchased this because I wanted some sort of sweetener for my coffee that would not affect my blood sugars. I found the flavoring to be a bit overpowering.  I ended up using less than the recommended amount.  I only use one drop in my coffee. I would suggest you start with one drop and then taste and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />To me the vanilla flavor tastes artificial but you can't find any information on the label other that it contains ""natural"" flavoring.<br /><br />But it does what it promises which is to sweeten and flavor. It will also last for a long time since only drops are used."

I tried all three ""flavors"" that I found in the bag (red, green, and blue), and found all of them to be disappointing when held up against my memories of being able to barely tolerate them when I was in high school.<br /><br />They are sour, but not ""lock your jaw up"" sour like they used to be. I remember them almost rivaling the sour power of Warheads... and while I still find Warheads to be ridiculous for the first few seconds, these gumballs just don't compare to the ones I remember. Good, not great.<br /><br />The only caveat I would add is that it was not ""Cry Baby"" gumballs, but ""Tear Jerkers Sour Bubble Gum"" printed on the wrappers. They're both manufactured by Tootsie Roll Industries, so they're pretty likely to be the same thing, but I haven't done a side-by-side comparison."

Nearly boutique chocolate level flavor that you could pick up for half the price.<br /><br />But to my shock the new recipe is simply garbage. Mundane, flat, lacking any punch. What the !@#% was Lindt thinking?  I, along with many others, will have to seek a new replacement for a serviceable bar that the Lindt 70% so faithfully provided for years.  Lindt, shame on you.

I opened up the can and tasted a couple. My immediate reaction was ""gross! Somebody mixed in red pepper with the gooseberries!"" I mean the gooseberry flavor was there - but so was the pepper flavor. I buy fresh gooseberries periodically so I know exactly what they should taste like - and this was just completely off. I should have stopped there - but I didn't. I made a pie using the recipe on the label. It turned out completely watery, and the pepper flavor was still there.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer about it. They asked me for the date code on the can. They looked in to it and opened up some cans from about the same time and tested those. They called me back today to essentially say ""hah! They taste fine. You're clearly crazy."" They then told me if I still had an issue with it I should bring it up with Amazon. Unbelievable.<br /><br />As a proud Oregonian, I am embarrassed to have this shady company using my state's name in their business name. Avoid this company and this product.<br /><br />Now I am again in search of a decent source for canned gooseberries. Canned gooseberries that don't taste like they've had pepper added."

His hair is sleek, shiny, and smooth. He has less dander as well.<br /><br />I can feel good about giving him Avoderm because it is an all natural product.

Before this I get him EVO a healthy blend of ingredients very short on the fillers and artificial colors.  Unfortunately for Beneful, I think it's marketed to owners by looks on the bag and as long as the dog lives and doesn't get appreciably sick people think it's OK.  If you read the ingredients and thought would I eat that, the answer would be a resounding no.

126101,B001E5E2GS,1.0,I'm the account holders wife....I bought this based on the good reviews.  I was disappointed. I made a batch of it and it was so bad I wouldn't even feed it to the livestock and they usually get all our scraps. The consistancy of the noodles was horrible and I followed the instructions and I even rinsed it.  I have made lots of spaghetti over the years and this one was the worst.  I'm going back to rice flour spaghetti.

128806,B0006TN06Q,1.0,Nearly $8 for a little tin of curry powder? Amazing.<br /><br />Either make your own (many recipes online) or buy another brand in an Asian grocery store or online for $2 or so.<br /><br />And Malaysian curry powder is VERY different from Indian or other curries. If a recipe calls for Malaysian curry powder get the real thing or the taste will be very disappointing.

157163,B0035DUVCQ,3.0,"We decided to buy this carousel rather than the one made by It because it held more (35 vs. 27) and because it was taller and narrower, thereby taking up a smaller footprint. The down side was that it is generally more expensive than the It version, but decided to make the additional investment for the above reasons. However, when we received it, it wasn't as well-made as we had hoped, mostly because it didn't stand straight, so when you spin it, the ""leaning tower"" rotates annoyingly from side to side. Decided to live with it rather than dealing with a return."

The cashews were crunchy and very sweet but I had a hard time finding the pomegranate like in the photo or even near it.  First 2 handfuls there was nada.  At the end there was a little which added an almost discernable tartness (which was why I bought them) and some sprinklings in the bottom of the bag but all very tiny.  Disappointed as I didn't buy simple, sweet cashews..could have gotten those in a larger quantity and for cheaper (and prefer the usual honey flavor of other brands to this vanilla).  I wasn't impressed. (I bought mine at a local grocery store and they were fresh.)"

135197,B0049OPXP0,1.0,"I am very unhappy and saddened to report that I will not be dealing with this bread company again and neither Amazon unless there is no alternatives. I bought a case and stored them in my kitchen which is cool. The bread was fine however within 1 week I opened a second loaf and noticed mold inside one of the loaves. I then checked the rest and also saw mold on every one . I checked the instructions again, the storing option was that it could be placed on your counter top , I contacted Amazon who referred me to the seller by e mail, I had a reply to say the bread should have been frozen immediately, this IS TOTALLY UNTRUE and not stated on the labels. Anyway I then filed an A-Z claim to wait over another week for Amazon to send me this short curt mail saying it was not covered under A-Z , I was shocked as they knew why I was claiming this item and now to say not covered is very poor service indeed.  I contacted Customer Service and instead of empathizing with me Paula in customer service started to tell me about expiry dates and her mother works in a bakery ! I don't need to hear that as I know all about GF bread and have been buying it for years. I could not even get to speak to a Manager after requests to do so and then was insulted with a $30 promotional voucher which I declined. I spent thousands with Amazon year after year and to be treated this was is very sad , what happened to your legendary service. I also notice that Amazon send me an e mail saying sorry they cant help and thanks for your business , truly amazing they just don't value their best customers<br /><br />Bottom line don't deal with this bread company as they don't live up to their promises and try to shirk their responsibility as the label is misleading and false"

164906,B001ELLB2U,3.0,"I purchased this raw honey, in hopes that it will do wonders for my health and my blemished skin, but my hopes were set up too high.<br /><br />The raw honey does have a unique taste at first but after half way through the bottle, the taste gets annoying. It's not as tasteful as the honey that is sold on grocery stores. This one is more thick and therefore makes it VERY hard to spread around your waffles or pancakes.<br /><br />I read many reviews stating that this honey is good for your health. Well ever since taking it, nothing really changed at all. I've had this honey for months and no significant health improvement of any kind has happen.<br /><br />I was mostly aiming at the skin issues that I have. I heard honey is recommended as a mask to kill bacteria on the skin that could cause blemishes. So with all of the health benefits that this honey was said to have, I trusted that it would not only improve my health but also help fight my acne. Well it sure didn't do a single thing to change my skin condition. Just hours of annoying thick honey on my face. No blemish was stopped, no quickness in fading away the red spots and absolutely no skin improvement of any kind. My skin didn't feel cleaner at all nor did it glow or changed a single thing. A simple soap sure left me more satisfy than putting this on my face day after day in hopes that it would help.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a good product if you are just using it as a substitute for sugar. It has that sweet taste for the sweet tooth. It's thick but if you have time you could warm it up in the microwave or in something hot.<br />THIS IS NOT A HEALTH REMEDY OR ACNE FIGHTING TOOL!!!<br /><br />So if your planning on getting this to help fight acne, I would recommend spending that money for a product that at least labels it self with the ingredients to fight acne. This is just for the sweet tooth!"

Then I discovered them in a catalog that deals in nostalgia. I don't know when they started making them again.Of course, I checked on line and found them much cheaper at Amazon. The price is right and the candy great. You smack the bar on a counter to crack it up to eat. It comes in other flavors, too. Only problem for me is that I would prefer to buy a box of assorted flavors instead of one box of 24 of one flavor, but since it's vanilla it's okay for now."

As someone who is both dairy & gluten free, it is often challenging to find a product this delicious. As other reviewers noted, the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar is indeed reminiscent of the Hershey's Mounds Bars. A careful review of the contents of the Hershey's Mounds Bar :NGREDIENTS: CORN SYRUP; SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE ( CHOCOLATE; SUGAR; COCOA; MILK FAT; COCOA BUTTER; SOY LECITHIN; PGPR, EMULSIFIER) ; COCONUT; SUGAR; SALT; NATURAL & ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR; HYDROLYZED MILK PROTEIN; SODIU, M METABISULFITE, TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS; SULFUR DIOXIDE, TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS; CARAMEL COLOR; MILK  followed by  the contents of the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar<br /><br />Ingredients: Coconuts, Rice Syrup, Dark Chocolate (Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Soy Lecithin, Natural Vanilla)<br />clearly<br />exemplifies the purity & quality of the product.<br /><br />Though the visual is not as attractive as the Mounds Bar, the absence of garbage ingredients makes the contents of the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar  far more nutritious, &  its taste far superior. Any time I find myself licking the wrapper,  it's an Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar!  I seriously try to eat only one a day.  I say try!"

I don't know what happened here, these were definitely not what I'm used to from Slim Jims. First there was no ""snap"" as you bite into the casing. Instead it was very mushy and I routinely squished the slim jim before I even could get them out of the wrapper. And probably worse still it just didn't taste very good. I didn't find it particularly spicey at all. Not even in the lots of spices, but not burn your mouth, kind of way. And the flavor was just not there. It didn't taste bad, but I would have much prefered regular Slim Jims to these supposedly Jerk flavored sticks."

Truthfully I was only able to drink about 1/3 of the can before I had to put it down.  If they would lighten up on some up the more sugary juice and let the other flavors come through it might not be as bad, but even my kids thought this one was too sweet.  This may be considered a ""healthy alternative"" because it is made with fruit juice and no added sugar, but the taste says otherwise."
133047,B0090X8IPM,1.0,"I like vanilla flavored coffee and expected to like this.  I figured Starbucks would deliver premium quality for a premium price.  But, this coffee didn't pass the taste test.  It was a pretty mild vanilla flavor and a pretty weak coffee flavor, neither of which appealed to me.  Yet the worst aspect of this coffee was the kind of artificial flavor aftertaste.  I'm not sure if that's worth buying unless they figure out a better formula."
17171,B000EH0RU2,5.0,"I wish I could buy this rice blend in my local store.  RiceSelect Royal Blend rice is for those of us who like flavorful mixed grains, with the firmer consistency only possible with long cook rice.  The nutrition in this grain combo is phenomenal and the taste is fabulous.  I buy the 4 jar package and it comes out cheaper than if I could actually talk my grocer into carrying it.  The flavors complement a gumbo, spanish rice,  a bacon/ham and pecan casserole, or anything with a stronger flavor even oriental and indian dishes.  For milder dishes like Indian Butter Chicken, you might like your regular white, basmati, or jasmine rices, although I generally use these whole grains for almost everything.  Jars were package very well, packed for shipping very well, and shipped promptly.  Rice lovers will love this product."

My jam always comes out beautifully.  Unfortunately, I ran out of Sure-Jell tonight, and used a packet of Pomona's Universal Pectin that was sitting in my cupboard instead.  BIG mistake.  The jam jelled, all right, but the final consistency was pasty and the brightness of the fruit flavors was totally clouded.  I got pretty much the same results as if I'd thickened my fruit with corn starch.  Ick!  Next time I'll stick with Sure-Jell."
75858,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I have to get to work pretty early, so I need something to get me started. I'm not crazy about coffee, so I've been trying to find an energy drink that agrees with me. This brand is the first I've found that both wakes me up and doesn't have that off-putting chemical aftertaste. It doesn't give me as much energy as some of the other brands I've tried, but it tastes better. It's a nice compromise between flavor and kick. However, if you're looking for a more powerful boost, look at some other brands -- but they'll probably taste worse than this."
81686,B001VDXO3K,4.0,"Ive been drinking coconut water my whole life and seriously LOVE the stuff.  When I first found VitaCoco all i could think was these guys are geniuses and somehow managed to create a coconut drink that actually tastes like the real coconut.  When I saw amazon was selling the product in boxes of 6 i thought, ""Even better, its shipped right to my door."" That is until i received my second shipment and found a box full of sticky Vita Coco packages with two of the boxes open and half empty.  I decided it would be apt o return the boxes, but for whatever reason, that is not in the Amazon return policy.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Love the product, but the shipment packaging sucks and Amazon wont allow you to receive credit or return the broken boxes."

150116,B003YBP6Q0,3.0,"Let me be clear, I thought the GoPicnic meals tasted good and were incredibly filling for the small amount of food in the kit. This is not to mention that the food provided is relatively healthy.<br /><br />My complaint comes in with the sheer cost of these meals. At around $4.16 per meal, this only becomes a good value only to those eating either very high-end foods or going out to eat for lunch every day. If you already take your lunch to school or work, chances are that your existing lunch is cheaper than it would be through GoPicnic.<br /><br />While Amazon gives a 15% discount and a $1.00 coupon, this still doesn't make it too much better. You're almost certainly better off buying hummus and crackers in bulk and portioning it out into lunches than by going this route. If you'd rather have convenience and don't mind paying a premium for it, then GoPicnic may be for you."
77775,B001LG940E,4.0,"Switch is the ""all natural"" soda that has no sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives and with vitamin C. The flavor in question is black cherry.  When I opened the can and took my first sip I was a bit taken back.  The first taste of this carbonated beverage tasted like pure sweet syrup.  I put the can down and allowed for my taste buds to reset.  I then grabbed a glass, put some ice in it and poured the rest of the soda.  Upon my second taste I was very pleased.  This soda has a very refreshing taste and almost tastes like Juicy Juice with carbonation added to it.  This is great way to get both your natural juice and avoid drinking ""too much"" soda.  Each can is 8.3 ounces has 130 calories.  Enjoy."

So, if you like oats and chocolate (I do!), then it's a tasty, if not wildly original, granola.<br /><br />However, it IS very messy to eat. The oat clusters fell into tiny bits and the chocolate smeared all over me when I tried to eat it by hand, so I ended up dumping it directly into my mouth from the bag to try to minimize the extent of the damage. (Not the greatest strategy for portion control!) This would be best eaten as a breakfast cereal, I daresay, than an on-the-go snack (especially for kids)."

150142,B003WP7ONG,3.0,"I love Splenda and have been using it since it first debuted on the market.  Unlike other artificial sweeteners, it has no aspartame (which I am allergic too).  It also dissolves easily in hot and cold drinks.  For the last 6 months, I've been counting calories to lose weight and control my portions better.  When I saw the new enriched Splenda, I decided to give it a try because I had a coupon.  I drink a lot of hot tea to help curb my snack cravings, and I thought the added fiber might make a cup feel more filling.  While I'm not sure if it is more filling, I have noticed that the Splenda with fiber is sweeter to me.  I used to use 2 packets of Splenda in my tea, but only need one of these.  I'm not sure if this is because each packet has more in it, or if the fiber enhances the sweetness. Otherwise, it tastes the same as regular Splenda.<br /><br />However, this product also has some disadvantages that will keep me from buying it regularly.  First, as another reviewer noted, the packets are not simple paper.  They are foil-lined to keep the fiber from hardening the Splenda.  While I understand the necessity, it is inconvenient.  I often spill a little trying to open them because I can't shake the granules to the bottom first.  Second, it does not dissolve as easily, especially in cold liquids.  It will dissolve, you just need to add it more slowly and stir a lot.  Finally, and most critically, Splenda essentials are a LOT more expensive.  A 400 count box of regular Splenda is $11 on Amazon Subscribe & Save as of this writing.  In contrast, the Splenda Essentials with B vitamin or Antioxidants (the fiber is not yet available) are almost $15 for 320 packets.  I found a similar price differential in my local grocery store and at Wal Mart.<br /><br />Overall, if these were the same price as regular Splenda, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. As it is, I won't buy them again unless I have a coupon that makes it worth while. It's a good idea; especially to add vitamins to your diet in something you already use regularly.  But, it's not worth the price hike."
129424,B004T06XWG,1.0,"When this product arrived, I noticed that it said on the label that it is ""PACKED BY"" Honeytreehoney, but there is no information as to where it is produced.

And I'm not sure I'll use it, either.<br /><br />The one star rating is simply an indication of my dissatisfaction for the information gap, not the taste/quality of the molasses."

17279,B0049PN92S,5.0,"I first tasted the donut house coffee's while waiting for an MRI. I am not a coffee drinker, at least I wasn't at that time. I made a cup of the donut house cinnamon roll flavor coffee. I didn't plan on drinking the coffee... I just wanted to try out the coffee maker. To my surprise the coffee was delicious. I came home and kept thinking about that cup of coffee. 3 months later I bought a Keurig coffee maker. I'm a little sensitive to caffeine so I decided to try the donut house decaf coffee. The donut house cinnamon roll used to be my favorite flavor coffee, well now the donut house decaf runs a close 2nd. I live in Michigan and on many cold nights I'll make a cup of the donut house decaf coffee before I go to bed."

77038,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I saw another review that warned against buying this product from Amazon if you live in a hot climate.  I would concur!  My weather is pretty close to what you'd find in Las Vegas and the chocolate had melted all over the place.  I think that was actually nice for what got stuck on the food but a lot of it stuck to the bag and was uneaten chocolate.  In some cultures, uneaten chocolate is one of the seven deadly sins.  So beware!<br /><br />Otherwise, this tasted pretty good.  If you love Granola, you can't go wrong by adding some chocolate to it.  It was a little hard for trail mix but it makes a good breakfast.  I'd say the only ones who shouldn't have this are those who do not like dark chocolate.  If you prefer milk chocolate than this product isn't for you."

When I first tasted it, I immediately checked the expiration date to make sure it did not go bad. Then I tried a few more hoping I will eventually like it and convince myself that Vita Coco can't possibly be this bad. But in the end I came across a bottle that just had a very foul taste so I decided to throw all of the remaining drinks away."
241365,B0044WPDPW,2.0,"I was excited to find pumpkin pancake mix online, and promptly ordered this four pack from Village Mixes. For pancakes, they're fine, not too different than your standard Bisquik pancakes. The chocolate chips are present in the perfect quantity, not too few, not too many, and they taste good. However, the mix is really lacking in the pumpkin flavor its advertised as. In fact, if the box didn't have a sticker on it that said pumpkin, I would have figured it was just plain. Also, there is no nutritional information for the pumpkin blend on the box (just for other types, like plain, blueberry, etc.). In all honesty, I will stick with Trader Joe's pumpkin pancake mix from now on. Its cheaper, and actually has pumpkin flavor. If you're looking for just regular pancakes (not pumpkin flavor), go ahead and order this."
82831,B007TGDXNO,4.0,"I like the flavor of this brand. It has taken me a while to find something I really like. Some of the Keurig options are too acidic for my taste. (But taste is subjective, isn't it?) Reviewers have complained because the cups aren't surrounded completely by plastic; they use a filter-like material instead. I suspect that the traditional filter aspect may make them better. I gave this four stars. To get five stars it would have to be the amazing. I have not yet found a Keurig brand (or lately even a traditional coffee bean) that rates in the Amazing category."
131018,B000CFJDWY,1.0,"These are a nice alternative to huge brand crackers, however they taste like pure salt. Try the ""saltine"" Late July crackers. I really regret buying these."
77135,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"This product delivers on its ""passion for keeping it simple"", as it delivers what its promises: a nice, tasty granola with chucks of chocolate.  Some products try to be more than they are, but this one seems comfortable in its own skin.  The ingredients are of a good quality and taste, and the texture is nice as well.  I've reviewed a number of food and drink products for Amazon Vine, and most of them leave me analyzing ""what went wrong"".  This product left me enjoying ""what went right"".  This was a good granola and one that I'd buy if I saw it in the store."
77626,B001LG940E,4.0,"I love cherry juice but it is hard to find in normal stores. I was expecting something tasting like cherry but that is not what this flavor is about. Cheery is actually the last (so least) of the juices included in the blend. To be fair, there is a hint of cherry taste but much more of an apple and grape taste.<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry is very good if you are looking for a drink that is a step-down in sweetness from soda but there still is a lot of sugar in there. So if flavored seltzer is too bland, this may be a nice middle ground compared to sodas that are full of sugar."

165906,B0009F3SA0,3.0,"First off, don't pay more than $3-$4 for this box. Kroger and some Walmarts carry this in their ""organic"" section.<br /><br />Secondly, the second time I used this I squeezed the teabag.  I was in a catatonic state for 4-5 hours afterward.  The best way I can describe this tea is that it WILL make you sleepy but doesn't put you to sleep.  My best analogy would compare this with alcohol.  Enough alcohol makes you drowsy but actually interferes with a restful sleep.<br /><br />BTW, valerian root acts on the same GABA receptors as Xanax, Ativan, and Klonipin.<br />If you've been using this for a long period, ween yourself off ... don't stop taking this abrubtly."
76085,B000O3R98Y,4.0,I read the reviews and did some non-trivial research online before buying this.  It's spicy and has a decent flavor.

I found them through a mommy blog and have been ordering then every month now!  My daughter started on them at about 8 months.  They soften and dissolve quickly in her mouth so no choking or much chewing.  She loves every flavor and they are GREAT for on the go.  100% Organic fruit without the mess involved with bringing along fresh fruit.  I don't have to worry about added chemicals, too much sugar, or other things found in baby/ toddler snacks.  Even I love them!!  Just make sure to close the bag because any moisture softens them up (still good, but they get sticky!)"

168449,B0001ES9F8,3.0,"Tried these pods because they were a good deal.  Used them with Pod adapter in keurig. The flavor is pretty good, but the pods are not that thick so it turns out as a weak cup of coffee."
237087,B004ZU0RAE,2.0,"I hardly ever write negative reviews, but I hope to save someone else the time and money I wasted on these bottles. I read the mediocre reviews on the Purely Comfi bottles. Nevertheless, I purchased them in hopes that my daughter would latch on and that the negative reviews were a result of others' being picky. I began with the Playtex nurser systems, because I thought they would be easiest with expressed breast milk, but my daughter would not latch on to the widemouth nipples after using small ones in the hospital.<br /><br />We used the 6 ounce size and had 6 bottles. I love the colors of the Comfi bottles, and I like the shape and size. The nipples are pretty good too; my daughter did well with them. However, there are some issues. Some of mine leak around the nipple, and others leak around the screw cap. Not only is it difficult to keep my daughter from getting wet, my precious breast milk is being ""fed"" to her outfit or bib! One of the most inconvenient things about the bottles: the nipple ring does not screw onto the bottle well. It's like there isn't enough thread on the bottle. More than a few times, I have pulled off the nipple cover only to see that the entire screw top and nipple came with it! Now I have to be very careful when removing the nipple cover. Then, after using the bottles for a while, I couldn't even get the tops to screw on at all. Two of my nipple covers have broken and can no longer be used. I don't even know how they broke. They haven't been subjected to any harsh conditions! The bottles also pour miserably. If I need an extra ounce from a bottle in the fridge, I cannot pour from one bottle to another without wasting milk and getting it all over the counter.<br />In summary, I would not buy these again. In Evenflo's defense, I contacted them, and they sent me more bottles, but they were no better. The customer service person was nice though. I regret buying these, because we had to buy all new bottles, which resulting in a few days if irritable feedings as my daughter has to get accustomed to a new nipple. I wish I had just bought the more expensive Dr. Brown's bottles from the beginning."
167513,B002MTUD1S,3.0,"It is nice tea for a low price. It has a slight sweet, light, and fruity taste but the quality isn't as high as I would expect from a green tea of this grade. In my opinion it's more akin to a Japanese Sencha than gyokuro. Although to be fair you can get this tea for bargain price. If you want a good gyokuro tea I recommend Teavana's Gyokuro (which i'm basing my opinion on)albeit it is about double the price for the same amount."

I'm not into candy and am trying to eat clean (Paleo), so thought this would be a nice snack idea for when I'm on the go, etc. Well, what bothers me is that it has glucose (the bar is very sweet) and soy. Otherwise, I think it's my favorite snack bar so far."
156301,B001C5GHCM,3.0,"The chunks of this granola are huge, which is fine if you want to eat it like a granola bar. But I want to eat as cereal, and these pieces are just way too big and hard. I emptied the bag onto a cutting board and chopped them into smaller pieces, which helped tremendously, but what a messy job! Pieces flying everywhere because they are so hard. These taste very good though, so if you don't mind the size and density, then you'll like these."
244538,B00389TID0,2.0,The only plus to Nissin Bowl Noodle is the dried vegetable packet. It's too salty and the noodles are flat noodles instead to the regular ramen noodles. You're better off buying the traditional Nissin Top Ramen than this.
77645,B001LG940E,4.0,"I found The Switch in Black Cherry refreshing.  Drink when cold!  It wasn't too sweet nor lacking taste.  It was just right. I liked that it didn't have sugar or corn syrup and that it was gluten free.  According to the can, it is 100% juice.  The only thing that I didn't like about this drink was its size - 8.3 ounces is just not enough.  It literally takes one gulp to finish the can.  I would have liked 12 oz or more.  The Switch is worth a try.  Recommend."
241041,B008EG58V8,2.0,"""Oatmeal Squares"" is in about the largest print you can fit on the Front of the Box.  When you read the ingredients, the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour.

This is really ""Oatmeal and Wheat Squares""<br /><br />Who cares how it tastes if it is not what it says it is."
17276,B000GPXRRW,5.0,The product arrived on time and is very good. I will order more in the future.
77110,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"This was a very good tasting cereal. Nice crunch and did not get soggy in the milk. The only thing I would say is that it had just a bit too much chocolate for me (I know I sound crazy saying that). I took some of the chocolate pieces out on the second bowl and it was perfect. The chocolate seems to throw the sweetness over the top for me and I don't like cereal to be too too sweet in the morning. However, if a sweet cereal suits you, then this is quite nice and the granola nuggets even flavor the milk a little. I enjoyed it and would recommend it. Very very good."

80585,B000W7PUL0,4.0,"This is boxed stuffing which -- as in all boxed foods -- in my mind is the equivalent of bland, bleh food. My husband, though, actually prefers this over my (sometimes) labor intensive homemade stuffing so I like to keep a quantity of it in the house for him. Making this according to the directions isn't something I've ever done so I can't really comment on that but I can say that with a quick few additions and substitutions, I can actually eat and enjoy this as well.<br /><br />First, I always use stock (usually chicken/duck -- whatever I have in my freezer) instead of water and add some sort of vegetable to it as well. Usually it's sauteed, grated carrots or zucchini but I've put everything in it at one point or another. I also add to the seasoning with whatever I think will taste good (sage is always great as well as any sort of chicken seasoning and I always add parsley if I have it fresh on hand).<br /><br />Here are some more suggestions to add to make your stuffing better that I've tried and liked:<br /><br />-- Cooked sausage -- breakfast sausage is always good but I've used brats and italian sausage as well and it's equally as good.<br />-- Bacon<br />-- Chicken livers (or turkey or duck or whatever you might be cooking)<br />-- Ground beef<br />-- Or you could go the fruit way and add apple, dried cranberries, raisins or even substitute some of the water for cider<br />-- Nuts (chestnuts and walnuts are what I've used)<br />-- Veggies -- Like I said above, grated carrots or zucchini is my standby but I always add onions, garlic, and sometimes celery or mushrooms as well.<br />-- Cheese -- parmesan in particular<br /><br />I also have a friend who swears by adding white rice to it as well but I haven't tried it (and personally think that that's an awful lot of carbs!)<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer has said, this is a fantastic donation item because it's easy to make as well as being very filling.<br /><br />Nutritional Information (1/6th of the box or 1/2 cup prepared stuffing):<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Calories from Fat: 50<br />Total Fat: 1g **<br />Saturated Fat: 0g **<br />Trans Fat: 0g **<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 450mg<br />Total Carb: 21g<br />Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 3g<br />Vitamin A: 8%<br />Vitamin C: 0%<br />Calcium: 0%<br />Iron: 6%<br /><br />** (plus whatever butter you use)<br /><br />*** Contains both wheat and soy"
148605,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"If you're craving a handy peanuty snack, then this will likely suit your tastes.  However, I found it a bit too sweet for the 'salty' I was looking for.<br /><br />While the package highlights 7gms of protein, don't think this is 'lean' protein.  With 13gms of fat per bar, you're packing away 20% of your RDA.  I was surprised at other contents as well.<br /><br />Pleasantly:<br />Sodium is 160gms (7%)<br />Carbs 22gms (12%)<br />Fiber 3g (12%)<br /><br />I expected all these numbers to be higher, so this swayed favor with me.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm not keen on the inclusion of corn syrup (though not hydrogenated) as an ingredient, but was happy that most of the rest of the listed ingredients were 'natural' in that I recognized the names. However, I'd hardly call this a 'granola' bar, as is listed on the packaging.  The 'granola' element is barely noticeable between the nuts and the peanut butter.<br /><br />I wouldn't plan on one a day to supplement my diet, but as an occasional quick and peanuty treat, it's not bad.<br /><br />My 3 year-old 'picky eater' niece enjoyed it too :)"
17953,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,I was impressed. It smells like peanut butter & has the same consistency as peanut butter. It really doesnt have much taste to it. The chocolate pb2 doesnt either. Theres a slight taste of peanut butter but I'm not sure if I'm tasting it or just smelling it. I love it cause it offers a protein without all the calories. Btw the calories as well as other values are identical in the plain & the chocolate. The real challenge is finding something to eat it on. Better on a cracker than bread. Best on toast
244973,B001E5E1PA,2.0,"It is tasty (like coffee mate which I actually like) but I'm afraid it's far less nutritious than soy milk or milk ---- 1 serving (23g powder) has 100 calories but only contains 2g of protein (26g of non-fat milk powder contains 9g protein!). And the list of ingredients for this product is long with several long words ...<br /><br />I will keep it but only as coffee creamer (To be fair, it is probably healthier than regular coffee creamer.) ButI don't think it is as natural, healthy, and nutritious as soy milk."
17564,B000CMIYWM,5.0,"I am a big fan of Yogi tea. They make great stuff. Always very high quality ingredients, very tasty blends. This is one of the 5-star varieties. Although it lists itself as chamomile and lavender, the flavor is predominantly a nice licorice, which combined with the other ingredients, is more like anise. It is also a moderately sweet tea. I'd call this a 'rich and full-bodied' herbal tea. And, although I'm not a big ""traditional remedy"" person, there do seem to be some real benefits to this and Relaxed Mind. However, it might be as much due to the enjoyment of a nice hot, flavorful cup of tea, as it is due to the herbs in the tea.<br /><br />Either way, the tea is full of flavor, and relaxing. Enjoy!"

158923,B002AN6LL2,3.0,"I initially got this toy to keep my normally active dog occupied during the 8 weeks of inactivity following her knee surgery. It's supposed to be of moderate difficulty, but is very easy for my Rottweiler.<br /><br />The plastic Dog Brick is sturdy, well made, and dishwasher safe. It would be better if it was a bit heavier so it didn't move around so much, though if your dog is small, this shouldn't be a problem. The compartments slide open way too easily. When my dog removes the middle bones with her paw (which must be removed before the compartments slide open), it jostles the entire game and causes some of the compartments to slide open on their own.<br /><br />I found that using a bit of peanut butter in each compartment instead of a dry treats, works VERY well. She works more methodically this way, and licking the peanut butter keeps her occupied a lot longer. However this toy still doesn't occupy her for long.<br /><br />Another plus is the holes in the ""bone"" pieces which fit between the sliding compartments. You can knot a rope into it if you'd like to give your dog an extra option for removal of the piece, and would maybe work well for a small dog.<br /><br />Although fun, this toy won't keep your dog busy for long at all. If you'd like to occupy your dog for longer, I'd recommend the Bob-A-Lot interactive toy."

16462,B003R6KY3M,5.0,"Yes, this is an usual flavor combination.  But the spiciness of the chili and the sweetness of the mango make a tasty combination.  This would make an excellent rim trimming for margaritas, good as a seasoning for fruit or corn, or terrific straight out of the bottle."

167671,B006BXUZVO,3.0,"I love cinnamon and I regularly eat Raisin Bran Crunch so I was looking forward to trying this cereal.  For the most part I was disappointed.  The flakes are much thinner than the Crunch flakes.  I'd equate them to the consistency of Grape Nuts Flakes.  The flavor was okay but I'd prefer something more substantial. I would have liked a stronger cinnamon taste too but as it's easy for me to add more that didn't bother me too much.  The real killer for me was that there were so few almonds. I got only a couple of them in each of my first two bowls.  Once I removed the inner wrapper from the box I could see that they really skimped on the quantity of almonds.  So, even ignoring my preference for a thicker flake, considering that they went too light on the cinnamon for my taste and really skimped on the almonds I can't see ever buying this brand."

77764,B001LG940E,4.0,"I'll start off by saying we're a family of soda drinkers. My daughter likes Sprite, and my wife and I drink one or two cans of Coke a day.<br /><br />Our family tried this for dinner one night, and everyone in the family really liked it and asked for more. This includes our two year old and four year old.<br /><br />Overall the flavor isn't overly sweet, so it doesn't have quite the cotton candy feeling that you get from Coke. While it isn't as sweet, it still tastes very good. There's no odd aftertaste, and it's not dry like sparkling water.<br /><br />The only complaint I might have is probably specific to the cherry flavor. While it was good, it definitely tasted a little bit like apple. It was almost like sparkling cider.<br /><br />I did appreciate that everything in the drink was natural, while still tasting great and not being incredibly expensive.<br /><br />We'll definitely have The Switch again, though maybe in a different flavor."

167035,B000EMK4JQ,3.0,"You'll love this if you plan to add seafood yourself to this pasta sauce.  I mixed in some white wine, can of crab, and chicken sausage and seasoned it a little myself and added some corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I plan to get a case of 12 and add my own lobster, scallops, shrimp for my next pasta dish.  But I agreed with the other comments on this.  Don't use this as your only pasta sauce.  Too plain, boring, watery and you won't find any lobster in the can.  But what do you expect for a can of pasta sauce that cost roughly $2-$3?"

249878,B000FSPQTM,2.0,"As I write my first review on Amazon, I enjoy sucking on the flavor of my 6th of 12 cans... each having nearly the same flavor yet severely lacking consistency in the portion (1/3 of a the can is ""full"" when opened in my current can versus 1/4 of the can in some instances and always below 1/2 in others). Moisture content is consistent but poor... most cans are as dry as Vegas in August and only one had a hint of moisture (maybe Colorado in summer?). The flavor is fairly consistent but to be a ""chew"", the cut is decent size overall but far from perfect. I'll finish these cans for the flavor and forget the variables and likely keep the cans to shred some of their Teriyaki flavored jerky in the food processor that they sent as a sample to place in the cans. That was tasty in ""stick"" form and the way jerky should be served! Overall, not very happy so would have to give it the thumbs down... Sorry Bill."

Everything is natural in this beverage, and yet it somehow didn't taste natural to me. I think this is due to its sweetness. If you like a sweeter beverage, you might like this product much more than I did. I was thinking the flavor would have been more subtle, but this was pretty assertive for my tastes."
135669,B003THML30,1.0,"I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2"" wide, 4"" long, and 1/4"" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away."

160558,B001AHJ9U4,3.0,"I tried this oatmeal after reading positive reviews and listening to the sales pitch of a home shopping TV host. It's OK oatmeal. Sure, in comparison to instant oatmeal, loaded withi sugar, it's better. But any whole oatmeal product from the health food store, or even Quaker oatmeal (not the instant) is just as good. Holly's oatmeal contains bits of dried fruit and nuts which is not that big of a deal. Any steel cut oatmeal or even Quaker whole oats can be made with fresh fruit, and a sprinkling of flax, nuts, or anything you desire to make a hearty healthful bowl. Holly's is over-rated. Holly sure has some gig going for herself. I rate it average, not better, than other types of oatmeal except for the instant kind."

Great for traveling, camping, or using as a ""safe food"" after a bout with the flu or stomach problems."
124841,B005EF0HRM,1.0,"When you first receive this basket you think wow this looks great.  However once you open it you start to realize how not great it is.<br /><br />1.  The most weird thing about this basket is that they items have been repackaged.  There is a box of carmel corn the cover made it look like it was a fake version of the item.  When you open it up you are even more suspicious b/c the caramel corn is inside a wheat thins box! huh? many of the items are similarly repackaged this way.  I would never send someone a basket that is so obviously homemade instead of a legit company.<br /><br />2.  many of the items were so small.  Inside was a tiny box of jelly beans, a one serving of peanuts, cashews etc.  I am use to seeing in baskets a can of nuts not a single serving snack travel pack. Also some of the items were a little strange to me - German hot mustard in a green tube...it didn't seem to match the caramel corn, jelly beans, nuts and crackers.  There was a package of sausage but still...<br /><br />3.  never heard of the brands -- now this could just be me.  these may be very famous brands and people know them all over the world.  But with the suspect packaging I thought the food itself was also of a lower class.  After tasting the items such as the caramel corn - which was stale, Hit cookies which were blah an oreo is better, and the malt shop taffies not very tasty, my disappointment just grew.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.  you could build a better basket on your own or go with a well known company.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />after I wrote this review Black Mountian now ig4U sent me a new basket.  It was packaged so much better.  It didn't look scary fake like the first one did.  I appreciate the company's effort to make right something that was not good.  I think that a person would be ok sending out their new and improved baskets.  I still stick to my original post that I think the food items were boring and not names that people would know but they tasted fine this time.  I change my star rating to 3 stars."

What more could you ask for, well I'll tell you, MORE! The can is only a skimpy 8.3 Ounces which barely rose above halfway in a normal sized drinking glass. Since it has no added sugar, corn syrup or other sweeteners I felt like I could drink more, it did not seem as ""heavy"" as soda, yet had all of the taste. Drinking this as an everyday beverage however would not be economically feasible for me, since I would have to drink 2 cans at a time to satisfy my quench. The taste itself is great, it totally reminded me of ""Dr. Brown's Black Cherry Soda"". It was not too tart and not too sweet. It had a pleasant after taste, which just left me wanting more..."
149386,B003ZXG00I,3.0,These cookies come in super cute packaging- but what they have in looks they lack in filling! The cookies themselves are tasty but they could definitely step it up and add more filling inside of each one.

BTW, that $79 per year has really paid off for me because what I order is always free shipping and always arrives in 2 days.

It's all the best flavors of the Yucatan in a bottle!  Lime, chili (but not too much) and salt, with a few others thrown in for good measure.  It's tangy, zippy, salty and wicked good on almost anything.  We roasted chicken with it, put it on the guacamole, stirred it into black beans and even used it to rim Margarita glasses.  I'd call it the best seasoning ever."

HFCS is chemically altered and unnatural and therefore is an artificial flavor. I found this labeling misleading and untrue. I wish they would use real sugar instead of HFCS. I know it costs a little more, but I believe parents would be willing to pay the extra money especially when it comes to our kids health. I know I would...KRAFT, please change your packaging and consider making the switch to REAL sugar."

254564,B000R923TU,2.0,these tomatoes look pretty in the can but lack flavor throughout.  you are better off buying premium brands for less at the grocery store and buying organic canned tomatoes.  all which will be under $3 a can at a good grocery store.

17666,B002Z04RNY,5.0,"My 10 month old twins LOVE these tiny dried fruits!  I love that they are organic!!  We've had the strawberry mix, the apple and the blueberry mix and they love all of them, but are particularly fond of the blueberries mixed in.  They pick out the blueberries before eating the rest.  These are freeze dried so they aren't gummy, but if you leave them out on a tray they will get gummier over time (maybe the moisture from the air?)  My twins didn't have a problem chewing them, but they've both had a lot of teeth for a while now.  One had 8 teeth at 7 months, the other had 6 teeth at the same time.  We started eating these at about 8 months old.  They have never choked on these (where they have with mum mum's and other types of crackers)"

I bought three bars of the original before the stock was replaced with the dreaded new recipe. Too bad chocolate doesn't keep well, I would have bought a box! If you like dark, coco tasting chocolate and are not fond of greasy tasteless bars that call themselves chocolate...don't waste your money on the new recipe. I hope Lindt gets the message and brings back the ORIGINAL recipe!"

I would recommend it to a friend.  However I didn't give it five stars because I found the can just to small. I was still thirsty after the drink, a regular soda can size would have been better.  Also although there is no sugar added you should remember that there is sugar in the fruit juice.  But over all a tasty little drink that I would have again."

Wolfgang Puck's version of creamy vodka sauce is a more bland-tasting sauce that doesn't add much kick to pasta dishes. I find myself having to add my own touch (seasoning) to it. In a bind, this vodka sauce will do; I'm just a little curious as to why this sauce doesn't have any punch. It more or less tastes like spaghetti sauce. Is it really a creamy spaghetti sauce? Not to mention the price is higher than a lot of sauces out there. Avoid this sauce if you can."

160896,B00141SPH4,3.0,"I've tried all the Dogswell products and my three mixed breed Malamutes like most of the products okay. They are less thrilled with the beef products than the chicken ones, which is odd, as they prefer most other brands' beef treats to the chicken counterparts. Happy Hips and Mellow Mutt seem to be their favorites, but they are fickle when it comes to this brand.<br /><br />What I like is that the product is manufactured under fairly stricy guidelines and with inspections so that while it is still Chinese Chicken, it is manufactured closer to US standards than many other similar products. You pay for this - but I love my dogs and I want them to be healthy and not exposed to too many frightening food stuffs (they find enough terrible things to ingest on their own).<br /><br />On balance, I think that this is one of the better chicken strip treats out there now. My dogs haven't become ill eating it and my vet says good things about it!"

However Naturapet, maker of Innova dog food was recently sold to Proctor & Gamble in June of 2010.  Shortly thereafter, both my dogs were furiously biting at their shins and feet in July and August 2010.  After several vet trips and medications (benadryl, steriod, antifungal) did not work, we switched to A Taste of the Wild dog food.  13 days later, the dogs are no longer itching.  This is not a coincidence - I believe either the ingredients or sourcing of ingredients changed when Innova was sold to P&G causing a severe food allergy for both my dogs.  I will never feed Innova again."
75746,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"Not really:)I absolutely love the taste of this energy drink, though! But does it give you energy? Yep. But I would only use it to do certain things or at certain times of the day. By that, I mean I wouldn't use a whole can of this stuff as pre-workout drink if I was planning on having a massive iron pounding workout. Off the top of my head, I think is roughly 175mg of caffeine in a whole can. It takes about twice that much caffeine for me a big and heavy workout day to give that ""in the zone"" iron punishing feeling. The best uses I've had with No Fear is drinking a half can in the morning for excellent pick-me-up and taking on days when all I plan to do at the gym is cardio or biceps. Small workouts. For those it works great and I get a good clean energy from it. No jitters. No stomach problems. In fact, I will usually drink half on the way to gym and save the other half while I'm doing cardio.<br /><br />I suppose the downside to No Fear, as with most energy drinks, is that it has quite a bit of sugar and calories. And it's slightly pricey. For me, the calories and sugar are mostly a non-issue since I have a fairly high metabolism rate and mostly watch what I eat(except on the weekends ;) A 16 ounce can has 260 calories and 66 grams of sugar. Not real good for some people. I'm not sensitive to caffeine, at all, so a half of a can may work wonders for some people. I think what really helps provide a good dose of energy(aside from the caffeine) with this stuff is it having 2 grams of Taurine in a can. Add in 200% of B12 and it all comes together to give a rather nice hit. I've tried numerous energy drinks over the years and most I haven't been impressed with either because of taste or lack of energy. The taste of this stuff is very good. Has a nice citrusy afterbite to it. Goes down smooth. The best energy drink I've tried is Knockout Punch. By test I mean taste, price and energy.... that stuff has 320+ mg of caffeine in a can... potent stuff.<br /><br />But you really can't go wrong with No Fear. It's a close 2nd to Knockout Punch Energy Drink. With No Fear you're going to get at excellent tasting energy that is going to give you a good kick in the seat of your shorts if you use it for the right purpose. Just don't drink a can 30 minutes before you workout and think you're going to train like Ronnie Coleman in his prime. I primarily use this a wake me up get me going morning coffee substitute. I hate coffee... but I like this stuff so much I bought a 12 pack after trying a free sample. I'm a stickler for high quality health supplements, so if I buy a case of something you can bet it's good stuff. I give it an 8.5 out of 10 or a 4.25 out of 5.<br /><br />If it would have had a whopping load of caffeine in it it would have gotten at least a 4.5 from me. The Knockout Punch I mentioned eariler I haven't reviewed yet, but I would give it a solid 4.5 stars out of 5, in comparison. With it's only really downsides being too much sugar and calories for some people. To be honest, even being in great shape, I don't need all of the excess junk calories and sugars I get. I don't really complain about that stuff, usually, but I know it's a concern for many people, which is why I always try to point that out in a review."
159593,B000V0H4A8,3.0,"There are a few things that I didn't see in the product description or other reviews.  One is that this product is made in the USA.  The nutrition facts say that there are 3.5 servings per bag and there are 130 calories per serving.  I am confused by the fact that the ingredients list organic safflower, organic sunflower, or organic soybean oil, yet the bag also states, ""...we lovingly air-pop all those premium kernels into fluffy white bursts of natural goodness.""  I thought air-popped meant no oil, yet the ingredients list oil and the calorie count indicates calories from oil (50 calories from fat).  Wouldn't this be healthier and more nutritious without the oil?  It is nice having a quick, already prepared snack, but I think I will go back to popping my own with my hot air popper when these are gone."
125123,B000NY8OLK,1.0,This used to be one of my favorite chocolate bars before they ruined it with soy lecithin.  I've been reading the other reviews and I'm really happy to see so many people saying the same thing.  My wife sent an e-mail to Lindt and they wrote back saying they had done extensive market research and had gotten positive feedback on the new recipe.  I have a very hard time believing that.<br />I have found some good alternatives but they more expensive.  Michel Cluizel 72% Noir de Cacao is very good but not as easy to find and about twice as expensive as the Lindt bar.  I hope Lindt will come to their senses and change it back.
130164,B0017U9VIO,1.0,"I bought these bars because I was looking for a good high protein bar without all the extra junk in it.  Right now I eat Luna Bars for breakfast as wanted something lower in sugar and higher in protein.  These looked like a great buy and, from the glowing reviews, I thought buying a case of them was pretty low risk.<br /><br />Boy was I mistaken.  These bars taste awful.  I eat a lot of natural and organic foods and I have never eaten anything so horrible tasting as these bars.  They have an aftertaste reminiscent of coffee grinds; and have a very heavy sticky texture to them.  They are dry and hard to chew and swallow without getting stuck in your throat.<br /><br />I tried them multiple times hoping that I would like them with time; but I still can't stomach them.  They actually make me feel kind of ill when I eat them.  My husband tried them and so did my son; neither of them could eat more than a bite.  Both of them ended up spitting it out into the trash.<br /><br />I would strongly caution getting a case of these before you try them first.  Given the other glowing reviews of this product, maybe I got a bad batch or something.  But, here I am a tofu and sushi lover, thinking that these vegetarian protein bars are the worst thing ever.<br /><br />My son uses the remaining bars as part of his play food for his kitchen.  The bars are very durable and have withstood many hours of playing; so I guess maybe they have that going for them."
77555,B001LG940E,4.0,"As a carbonated version of the juice boxes that my children enjoy, this product is good, and reasonably priced.  However, as a ""Black Cherry"" soda, this product is a bit lacking.<br /><br />Seeing as it is advertised as a ""Black Cherry"" product, I would have expected cherry juice to be a bit higher on the list of ingredients than it is:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, cherry juice concentrates), natural flavor and color, citric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C).  Unfortunately the taste reflects the ingredients used; though there is a bit of cherry taste in this soda it is not nearly enough to make it distinctive for me.<br /><br />However, at a reasonable price point, and without the sugars or corn syrup of traditional sodas, I think that this is a fine bevarage choice for the kids if they want something ""fizzy."""

159317,B001IZI8FA,3.0,"Kool-Aid seems to be the only brand of unsweetened soft drink mix. I prefer this kind of product because I want to choose what sweetener (white/brown sugar, Splenda, honey, etc.) I'd use and the amount of sweetness. Plus, there are some drinks that are too sweet, so I love the option to tone down the sweet, increase the tart.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price ($0.23/packet). Although I've seen a packet up to $0.35 in local stores, during many sales a packet goes for $0.10. Generally, I'd expect when buying in bulk like this, there'd be a better discount.<br /><br />I guess when there's no competition, there's no motivation to offer better discounts.

I don't know if I got a bad batch but as soon as you put on milk it was a brownish soggy mess, very little chocolate (just the dusting on the pears) and well...just...""off"".

The raspberry adds a little more zing then the other flavors but they are all really excellent.

Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.

133441,B0090X8IPM,1.0,"Can I give it no stars?<br /><br />The bag arrived and I was all excited. Coffee does that to me. I'm a coffee snob. There I said it. It's not the most expensive brand nor is it the exotic nature of the coffee that is my snobbery. I love a good strong cup of coffee. To me coffee is a experience for all your senses. This failed.<br /><br />The first moment the bag was in my hands I smelled it, a slight hint of vanilla through the packaging. The best coffee I have had always manages to smell like the addictive bean no matter how it's packaged. That is nothing to hold against Starbucks vanilla though. Great and even good coffee sometimes only release their fragrance after opening. When opened, the package gave a distinct smell of vanilla. So strongly in fact that my head popped back, it smelled like cheap vanilla perfume that I got as a child at the five and dime.<br /><br />I got down to business, packing my coffee maker, frothing the milk and setting out the mugs. Once the coffee was done the smell mellowed a little but still was not appealing. My first sip was confusion. It tasted like coffee made with old milk. I looked at the container of milk which was fresh. I dumped out all the coffee and cleaned the pot again. Second pot same thing.<br /><br />So I left it all for another day. I bought new milk, made my first cup from my favorite brand and it tasted wonderfully. The second pot I made from the starbucks bag. The same results the coffee tasted like it was made with old milk. It was tangy, off and repelling. I asked my friend to try it. No prompting from me and he asked ""Something wrong with the milk? You want me to go downstair and get some?""<br /><br />3 tries from me and one with a friend, each cup was horrid. My regular coffee tasted great. The $1.99 a pound brand that my friend bought to ""test"" the pot and milk was a good solid cup of coffee.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and buy something else. This is horrible."

77716,B001LG940E,4.0,"Nice smooth taste, even with the carbonation.  It DOES taste like cherry juice.  Light in color.  The can says it is 100% juice--no sugar added and no preservatives--100% RDA vitamin C--all natural, no artificial colors and gluten free.  (Gluten free is a big deal to those with gluten intolerance, like one of my girlfriends.) 8.3 fl oz  can/245 ml.  Calories in the entire can 130.  Sodium 15mg, carbs 35mg, sugars 33g.  As you know, there is a certain amount of natural sugar in fruits anyway.  Ingredients (in order listed) are:100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates), apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates, natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C).<br /><br />Quite a nice taste and I am pretty picky.  I don't generally drink sodas or any carbonated beverages any more.  I try to consume mostly healthy products. This is really pretty good tasting and a decent alternative to a soda, especially for a child's lunchbox.  It actually seems to taste even better as you drink more of it, too. It's not a big can but it's big enough.  I certainly recommend it.  By the way, it's a pop top (like a beer)--schnik!--fizz. (Then you can give the little aluminum pop thingie to whoever's child is collecting them for school and recycle the rest of the aluminum can.--Just a little trivia: I toured an aluminum plant a couple of years ago.

It's my fault for not knowing at the time that 30 grams is equal to only 1.1 ounces.  But, I think it's misleading of the seller to over-inflate the shipping weight, and then list it in ounces, to suggest you're getting more tea than you really are.  I was also taken in buy all the comments stating that this tea is a ""great value.""  It's not at all a great value.  It's $24 for a little over an ounce of tea.

She first thought she was to take the entire container into her mouth. When I didn't give her the opportunity to try to swallow the whole thing, she tasted the juice on the ball. Deciding it was pretty good, she looked around to see if any other dogs might just have happened to come by for a visit. She is a picky eater. When she reacts by looking to see if any other dogs are around, it is evident that something is extra tasty. If she really, really likes something super tasty, she doesn't take the time to look around for other dogs. She has licked it a few times, but she seems somewhat reluctant. The low-calorie idea is neat, but my picky eater needs all the calories she can get.<br /><br />From a people's perspective it seems a good product, but no matter how much I shake it, I find it necessary to turn the ball manually to make the juice available.

Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product.

If you can bear that strong taste and after taste than you may wind up loving these crackers.  Good but not for everybody.

During the Fall I usually get one or at the most two pumpkin related drinks, then I'm done until next season.  I mostly got this because my girlfriend loves pumpkin spice flavored coffees from places like Starbucks.  I tried it and thought the flavor was a little weird tasting, not bad necessarily - but strange none the less.  I couldn't finish my cup.  My girlfriend said she thought the mixture was way too heavy on the spice side and very little pumpkin flavoring.  Although she finished her cup, she said she wouldn't want to drink anymore.  There must be a big difference in this and the coffee house drinks, since my girlfriends still drinks those all of the time.  Somehow I either got a bad mixture or these are just being made with too much spice.  Personally I'd say it's worth trying, but if you are looking for a premium pumpkin coffee alternative - look elsewhere."

Dry, tasteless, useless, but less fat.<br /><br />I have to say that I was wrong!<br />It smells pretty darned good when you open the jar up. It is powder, so<br />I used a knife to only cut half the lid off. That way, if my fumble fingers<br />dropped the jar, I would not spill as much of this - it is pretty pricey.<br /><br />I like peanut butters, but don't eat enough of it to really use it up before<br />it separates into oil/goo.  This is the answer for me. You just mix up what you need!<br /><br />Basically, this is just powder that mixes with water. While directions say two Tbls of powder<br />to one Tbl of water, who wants to really measure peanut butter? Best eyeball judging that I could<br />say for advice, is to get a small bowl, and put enough water in it to be about the amount<br />that you want to have of peanut butter. Use a spoon or fork, either one. Sprinkle the<br />powder over the water generously and mix, mix, mix. If it is too runny for your desired use,<br />sprinkle a little more powder and mix again. Repeat until it is just like you want it. I did find<br />that I had to mix it more than I thought I would to get the desired consistency/texture. If you<br />don't mix it enough, it will feel grainy to the tongue.<br /><br />The freedom to have it slightly runny for dipping, or thicker for spreading, is so nice!<br />While I honestly thought I wouldn't like it, I really do. I made a small batch up, intending to<br />dip my finger in it for taste testing. This is how I learned about not putting so much water in the bowl.<br />I had more peanut butter than I really wanted. So, son and I whipped out a package of Ritz crackers<br />and thoroughly enjoyed dipping/spreading it on the crackers.

18025,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"I love high-octane peanut butter, but not the fat/calorie content.<br /><br />TASTE: If you are accustomed to low-salt or raw products, the taste will be fine. If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.<br /><br />TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me).<br /><br />MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)<br /><br />USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.<br /><br />COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;)<br />BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a ""PRO"" because it helps with portion control.

I use a pump machine but I doubt that a drip maker would do any better.  I suspect they are buying reject beans to stay at the bottom of the price scale.  If you are looking for a budget brand try Bustello in the yellow can
241815,B0081XPTBS,2.0,"This product gets 2 stars for being organic and having no GEI's. However, when I checked out the ingredient list and saw ""glucose syrup"", I was suspicious. I contacted customer service and asked them what the glucose was derived from. This is the answer that I got:<br /><br />""The glucose syrup is from corn syrup solids.  It is a source of carbohydrates and is included to meet the label's nutrition claim for carbohydrate.""<br /><br />Very disappointing, as I really try to keep our diet free from corn syrup and other unhealthy fillers. I don't want my baby to drink this."

165646,B001YJBLLS,3.0,"I was hoping that these Danishes would be close to those that I can obtain locally. I was disappointed. THey taste good but need twice as much cheese as they have. Some of those I ate hardly had any taste of cheese at all. When there was cheese, it tasted good but was overwhelmed by the taste of the frostng and the cake itself. So unless you like only a slight taste of cheese you will have to look elsewhere."

136620,B000JJXC70,1.0,I got these and opened a package quickly giving some to my cat only to notice they were moldy.  Noticed package expiration date has passed some time ago.  Cat was mad when I took them back from her.  I suppose these would be pretty good if not spoiled.
256259,B001E530A2,2.0,"This product contains Trans Fat (e.g. hydrogenated palm kernel oil), a lot of Saturated Fat, and added sugar (e.g. Sugar, Corn syrup, and Maltodextrin). My wife bought me a package of these because I love cherries; however, I will not buy them again because of the preservatives, fat, and sweeteners added to an otherwise healthy product. This is far from a healthy product. The taste was not bad, but it did taste as these were sitting on a shelf for a while (they had a 'musty' taste), even though the expiration was almost a year away (May 24, 2011). I will probably end up buying a de-pitting food processor and just buy cherries from a 'pick you own' farm next year and make my own because I refuse to keep subjecting myself to bad products. I will also look at Sunmaid raisens that my son eats more closely now after this company unethically puts preservatives in their products to extend shelf life."

82325,B0060JMVM0,4.0,I am very pleased with this product. It's taste good. The little sit back is the tin itself. You have to pour the oil in an other bottle or will have a mess every time.
75553,B000FO1NFC,4.0,I ordered these for the family so they could have a familiar taste from home.  They were so excited.  This product was fresh so I was very pleased.
134430,B003E728CE,1.0,the pill pockets are supposed to be little ROUND treats so you can put the pill in the middle. The packaging Amazon used is what they would use for a flat book. This whole package is smooshed and ruined and one big flat sheet of treats. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with Amazon's shipping. I will not be ordering this item again from them and I am a little disappointed because this is the best price I have found for these anymore! I guess the cheap price comes with a cost!
16904,B001LGGH40,5.0,"I was skeptical when I tried this, but boy what a delight.  The flavor is deep but not too heavy, and the carbonation is just right; it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the juice.  It actually has a good ""mouth-feel"" - I drank it 15 minutes ago, and I can still feel a little hint of it.  It's like I had a thin slice of fresh kiwi and strawberry melting in my mouth."
149769,B00004S1C5,3.0,"I've used liquid and paste color in the past and this product seems to be somewhere in between.  I had to use quite a bit of the substance to achieve the color I was looking for.  In paste colors, you get a dramatic result with just a drop.  The Ateco are quite a bit better than the liquid color, and, for the price, it's probably about right.<br /><br />The bottom line - You get what you pay for.  If you want dramatic colors, you can achieve that using a good portion of the bottle.  If you want subtle colors, this may be what you're looking for."

150105,B003YBP6Q0,3.0,"I'm a GF/CF mom, and I was looking for something: #1 to bring with me when I to go work, #2 to send with my daughter for lunches, and #3 to bring for the family when we go on a ""field trip"" like to the museum or the pool.<br /><br />#1: GREAT choice! I LOVE the hummus, crackers, and fruit/nuts. The soybeans are ok. I give the chocolate to my husband or a friend. (I'm trying to avoid sugar.) I like that the meal is high in protein (25g!!) and fiber (12g!!). The individual packages make it easy to adjust to the size of my hunger: have one thing now; eat another later. Also, it's great to have a quick GF/CF option for times when I know I won't have a fridge or a stove.<br /><br />#2: Bad choice! These are not for children--even an adventurous one like mine! For example, the fruit and nut mix is called ""Baja Blend"", and it contains ""Habanero Almonds"" and . Few children will be able to handle this level of spiciness. My daughter LOVE edamame so I thought she'd go for them roasted, but these are very strong. Even the chocolate is a very bitter, dark chocolate. It's just not kid-food.<br /><br />#3 Ok choice. Divided amongst our family we can easily find someone to take each item from this box, and the fact that each item is individually wrapped makes it nice for the snack-style eating we do on a field trip, but they're really just too expensive to be used in this way. We're better off just packing the items that we want."
156015,B000WFPN82,3.0,"Do not buy this product at the moment!  It was just recalled.  No point in buying food that could be subject to a recall if you cannot check the Production code on the bag to ensure that you don't have a bad batch!  My dog likes this food and there is nothing wrong with it otherwise, I am simply mentioning to wait until this is cleared up before buying the food to avoid getting food you can't use."
132539,B001RRMUJE,1.0,"I bought this as part of a large order with other spices.  This seasoning is terrible.  The final product comes out chalky with a slight hint of jerky flavor.  Luckily, I ordered other spices that I will need to doctor this stuff up to make it passable."
256526,B003JA5KBW,2.0,"I received the EBOOST Acai Pomegranate and decided to try it one afternoon. My first impression was it smelled like jello. I added the content to a glass of cold water and took my first sip. I'm not sure if I would buy it for the taste. It tasted sour, artificial and somewhat carbonated that seem to irritate my throat a little bit.<br /><br />As I took additional sips, perhaps I liked the taste a little better. But the sour effect was strong and some people might get some stomach discomfort.<br /><br />Again, the taste is sharp, sour and not very enjoyable to drink on a daily basis. It almost tasted like squeezing a lemon and drinking it on an empty stomach. I usually eat my lunch around 12:30 and it was around 3:00 pm in the afternoon when I tried this product. I wouldn't say it's terrible, but you feel you need to eat something after you drink it to take away the sourness.<br /><br />One thing that caught my attention was the warning on the package against using this product if you have high blood pressure.<br /><br />Final note: About 30 minutes after taking this product, I felt my blood pressure rose to a high level - the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee for me.<br /><br />Conclusion:  The sour effect during and hours afterwards and the risk of raising the blood pressure to a dangerous level with some people make me not recommend this products. I think there are many more natural and healthier choices out there."
136545,B006Q820X0,1.0,"Brooklyn ""French Roast"" K-Cup Coffee is not one of my favorites. It's not awful.  It's okay if you're in a ""pinch"" and it's the only pod you have.

77082,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I loved this granola. The chocolate pieces were a great addition! Wonderful flavor and great in milk. My own personal preference is a little chunkier granola, and this is definitely not chunky. The kids wanted some and I let them try (they loved it too), but the package is pretty small, so not economical for our big family. I can't imagine anyone not liking this if you like granola and chocolate!"

81777,B005CUU25G,4.0,My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.
167616,B006BXUZVO,3.0,"While no worse than your average bowl of Raisin Bran, I was disappointed that I didn't find this to be noticeably better. The flavor of cinnamon could certainly be stronger (for my tastes, anyway), and the little slivers of almonds didn't really add to the ""crunch"" in any sort of meaningful way. And unlike the experience of some other reviewers, I found that this Raisin Bran got soggy remarkably fast after the milk was added, turning to slurry by the last few bites. I've definitely had other Raisin and Bran products that remained crisp longer.<br /><br />I was also a bit taken aback by the box, which holds only 14.5 ounces of cereal. It's the same height and width as the regular cereal box you'd see on the store shelf, but to hide the fact that you're not getting much cereal, the box is so skinny that I actually had trouble getting it to stand on end a time or two. And maybe this is common to a lot of cereals these days - it was just new to me.<br /><br />Overall, I've got nothing bad to say about this product...but to give it a rating of more than 3 stars, I'd have to feel like it was ""better than average"" somehow. And it simply wasn't."
164409,B0000VMA4S,3.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for but couldln't find at more local store. I wouldln't have ordered it if I didn't have PRIME, way over-priced."
79549,B003TNANSO,4.0,"These bars were delicious. The nuts were great, the honey flavor came through, and the dark chocolate was spot on.

81400,B003ZXFWZC,4.0,I would have given this 5 stars but because of my daughter's red dye allergy she could't enjoy this as well.  All the flavors were wonderful.  It tastes great.  I just wish that they would have used natural dyes to dye the berries red.  There are so many healthier options to chemical dyes.
82491,B003IDF86C,4.0,"I have a similar product that I purchased at Wal-Mart for less than $5 for 19.25 oz., so this price is way too high.  The product currently comes with 20% free, so it probably is usually available in a 16 oz. size.  The product that I purchased is called Ann's House ""Good Health Energy"", but it appears to be a similar mix of soynuts, cranberries, almonds and pumpkin kernels.  A 1/4 serving provides 8 grams of fat, 6 grams of sugar, 3 grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein.  There are other mixes available including Macadamia Perfection, Cranberry Nut Antioxidant, Chocolate Nut Antioxidant, Creamy Strawberry Almond and Pistachio Perfection.  I did not see all of these at the store.  The product is very high quality and Ann's House has been in business since 1973."
80603,B001EQ4G6I,4.0,"Coffee portions (cups) are 6 oz. If you like your coffee strong, you'll get one large 12-14 oz cup with one pouch. The flavor of this coffee is very good.  If you own a hotel type 4 cup coffee brewer like the Jerdon First Class, these work far better than trying to use #2 cone filters. Cone filters aren't meant to be used in hotel type round pouch brewing containers, the cone collapses and some grinds leak out. I gave up on square pouches with coffee, the square pouches let hot water drip by (in the round brew container) which dilutes the coffee. These are the best 4 cup round coffee pouches I've come across. These pouches are somewhat expensive per cup, but I only drink 2 cups a day."

75867,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I really like the concept of energy drinks--chug some ounces and get a boost of stamina to continue the day (or night). Most of them offend my taste buds! Absolutely cannot stand the taste of a few of the better known energy drinks.  The taste of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO6NI8"">No Fear,Super Energy Supplement, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> was great, not even sure how to describe it. More of a juice taste than a fake alcohol taste like a few I've tried.<br /><br />While the drink has a great taste and there is more of it than many energy boosters, I can't say I saw a huge difference in my energy levels. I spent last week looking after three kids under six and could really have used a shot of energy, but didn't see any difference (unless my levels were so depleted that only a good night's sleep would have sufficed to raise them again) in energy, stamina, or being less tired.<br /><br />The can has two servings at 130 calories per serving or 260 per can so unless you stay active, you'll probably pack the pounds on if you guzzle this in place of something else!<br /><br />So to sum it up--great taste, not so great on the energy levels!"

I called in to their customer service and of course they didn't know what I was talking about.

167685,B006BXUZVO,3.0,"So many cereals and so few mornings to enjoy them!  I remember the time when I would choose between Cheerios or corn flakes, now my pantry probably has 15 different cereals including oatmeal; however I have always been a raisin bran fan and often could trick myself into thinking I was eating something healthy (bran). 18 grams of sugar is not a small amount and with the addition of cinnamon added to the coated sweetened raisins the pandering to children's taste buds is ridiculous.  I admit I like the addition of almonds, but I believe this has been done before?  Using my box of puffed rice (naturally sweet) as a sort of base comparison, I was astonished to contrast it with the Raisin bran ingredients.  Puffed rice has no added sugar but is sweet enough, while the raisin bran has sugar, brown sugar, dextrose, cinnamon and honey.  (The last 4 items are under 2% but who needs them.)<br /><br />Could I become addicted to this cereal, probably yes.  But even after the first taste test (A full bowl of just raisin bran Cinnamon Almond) I knew I would have to mix it with something else (Shredded wheat for example) to bring down the sugar count and the calories (240 with milk).  My general advice is don't give up on basic raisin bran but stay away from the expanded raisin brans.  This new product will not revive the cereal industry, but push us more toward generic healthier cereals."

Also, some were trimmed too close to the seam.  When I opened the shipping box, loose soynuts were everywhere.  What a mess!  I am wondering if these packages are seconds that were singled out at the factory as not deliverable to retail grocery stores.<br /><br />I have trouble getting these at the local grocery store because they keep running out of stock!

The problem is the sweep of the pincers is too wide and the mechanism too easily clogged with sand or dirt. Don't bother with these traps.

About two hours after eating the recommended serving size I began having severe stomach cramps, as if I had taken a laxative.  Not too long after the cramps began I had to literally run to the restroom.  I thought that one trip to the restroom would have sufficed and proceeded to go to the gym...BIG MISTAKE!!!

K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense!

161391,B004W55ZBI,3.0,"I thought I would love these based on the glowing reviews.  They are simply okay.  I doubt I'll buy them again.  I love that they are gluten free but that comes at a price.  The cookie part is always in pieces.  I pick up a cookie to take the first bite & never make it to my lips before half the cookie ends up on my lap or the floor.  What remains in my hands is also crumbling.  It seems the mere act of picking up the cookie causes it to have structural failure.  The inner part of the cookie stays true.  The addition of gelatin might have something to do with this.<br /><br />The taste is okay.  What flavor they have is tasty but there's not a lot of it.  The best thing about them is they come packaged 2 in a pack.  This makes them very convenient to take on the go & you don't have to worry about an open box going stale.  The box states that the packaging is non toxic aka green.  Not a lot of companies can make that claim.<br /><br />Even though I am not thrilled with these, I plan on trying the chocolate creme filled & the vanilla creme filled either when I find them at the store or when amazon offers them with the super saver shipping.<br /><br />On a final note, just for the heck of it, I put them in the toaster oven to have a breakfast treat with my tea.  They taste a bit better this way, but still fall completely apart - except for the gelatin filling which needs more figs."

Others report grape juice flavor; I also think there's some watermelon flavor in there too. It certainly doesn't taste bad, and I don't detect any chemical or other aftertaste. I still do prefer my classic energy drinks, but I have no regrets about trying this one out.<br /><br />The bottom line is, if you need a kick and don't like Red Bull and Monster, and coffee's not your thing either, you might want to give No Fear a try."

Food is an item that could be adulterated by a evil-thinking customer, then returned.

Of course these drinks have caffeine and who doesn't need caffeine. But another attractive feature that leads to addiction is carbonation. Who doesn't like that fizzy feeling?<br />So, why not take a reasonably healthy drink like 100% fruit juice and make it carbonated? Brilliant! You get the sugar rush (but healthy sugars!) and the carbonation, without the crazy ingredients of most soda drinks.<br />You'll never need a mystery-fruit-flavored high fructose corn syrup, Yellow Dye # 9 concoction again!<br />I just wish the cans were a little bigger. This is one drink that can afford to be super-sized."

This is the best k-cup I have tried yet. You can use the ""larger cup"" button on these k-cups and get a great tasting, aromatic, strong cup of coffee. I can even see a little bit of foam around the rim of my cup when the brewing is complete. If you do not like strong coffee (as the French Roast always is) then don't buy this coffee. I will be trying the Pikes Place k-cup next.<br /><br />P.S.  As for the Dunkin' Donuts K-cups, do not waste your time. They are the same price as Starbucks, and you can only get them at the stores.

It's tart, but has sufficient sweetness to balance the tartness.  Best of all, there are no unwanted ingredients in this.  It's basically a carbonated fruit juice. There is no added sugar, or, worse, high fructose corn syrup.  There are no artificial preservatives or colors or anything else that's typically added to a soda (or even a juice drink).

The taste of the fruit is bland; you really have to struggle to find any apricot flavor at all.  Worse, my sensitive tounge noticed sulfur overtones.  Furthermore, these apricots are not really dried; they are really soft and mushy.  You will notice right away if you are used to dried peaches or apples.  Finally, I thought that it was odd that in this day and age they did not come in a resealable container.<br /><br />These might have a use in adding color to a salad.

It was a much more efficient method.<br /><br />The 'set it and forget it' motto is nice, however it cannot be used with every food.

It does take more coffee to make a decent cup (which decaf doesn't?), heightening the burnt flavor, but brewing with less coffee just made it watery and still burnt tasting. I'm giving it 2 stars because at least it wasn't bland like much decaf coffee. Overall, though, I found it disappointing."

Amazon cannot take the time to label this item as glass or fragile, so the postal service it going to handle it as if it were a box of books. The packing material was 3 air pack bags, they were so tightly packed inside the outer container they were all popped.

157690,B000EVNYRG,3.0,"I wish I would have heeded another reviewer's comments about this product not tasting good. She was right. Sometimes the majority is wrong! These are not like Honey Grahams, and in fact, they have very little ""graham"" taste (actually just pretty flavorless overall). They are not ""light and crispy"" as the package states. Instead, they are thick and crunchy--probably excellent for a toddler cookie to be knawed on over time, especially since there is hardly any sweetness to them. However, since I am not a toddler and my taste buds already know what a graham cracker should taste like, these fell way short.<br />They sound healthy though, if that is exclusively what you are looking for--or if you like foods with very little flavor. The package says that the Amaranth flour that these contain along with wheat flour, has a bunch of nutrients not found in other flours. I'm still trying ways to make them palatable for ingestion (dipping in milk-they don't even get soggy, slathering stuff on top of them, etc.). Thankfully, my dogs like them.<br />Sadly, Amazon will not allow these to be returned, so I am stuck with six boxes. I called Health Valley on their ""customer promise of satisfaction"", and to their credit, while they could not replace the case, they did offer to send coupons for other HV items to compensate.<br /><br />I'd suggest you try to find them in a grocery and try one box to see if you like them before ordering the case."

247765,B0015Q8VAE,2.0,"""M&uuml;esli"" is the diminutive of the German word for ""mush"", and as some of the favorable reviews declare, mushiness is the goal for M&uuml;esli-eaters. Authentic M&uuml;esli becomes mushy almost instantly when milk is added, though modern commercial Mueslis usually contain desiccated fruit and nut chips that stay gritty in the mush. And a lot of sugar to melt the mush together! If you've spent time in Germany or Switzerland, you'll know that you're expected to add fresh fruit and berries to your Mush, and to soften it with yoghurt or quark in preference to plain milk.<br /><br />The stuff is supposed to be wonderfully healthful, but if you compare the calories to various brands of granola, you'll find that both are higher than you thought, because of the sweeteners. Unsweetened oat bran flakes will get just as mushy almost as quickly, and you can be selective about your mix-ins.<br /><br />The 'Familia' brand dominates the supermarket shelves in most parts of the USA. If you've tried it and you like it, Mazel Tov! But don't buy M&uuml;esli in bulk or in six-packs! It gets stale and extra-tasteless on the shelf, even when the box is unopened.

I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me.  Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words.

They were delivered by the U.S. Mail and they are so hard, that even the mail carrier did not crush them when they were stuffed in my mail box.  I did not expect the cookie to be so hard and have a burnt appearance.<br /><br />I really wanted to like these cookies because I do try to buy organic products when I can.  However, these cookies had a strange flavor that lingered long after I finished one.  The ginger is just overpowering.  My tongue is still tingling a bit.  Maybe it is just me because other reviewers have given this cookie high ratings.<br /><br />I think that Newman's Own Organics makes some wonderful items, but this is not one of them.  I will buy Nabisco Ginger Snaps next time."

The people that gave it the best rating were the ones that doctored up the brew with  a lot of sugar and heavy cream..<br />6.Those like me who just uses a splash of cream felt it was way too bitter and not smooth at all.. In fact it had a rather harsh taste.<br /><br /> Sorry this won't be one of the flavors we will be using in the future. Though I do like a number the Gevalia blends this isn't one of them"
136065,B005SPQENY,1.0,"I got this Chantea thinking my Mother and I might like as a change from colas. She would not taste it after looking closely at it. I drank as much as I could bear. I cannot stress enough how nasty this Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, Passion Fruit is. The first impression was the smell and it actually smells really good. Second was the look of the drink - it has a yellow tint and these chunks of aloe vera pulp suspended in it. Shaking the bottle vigorously did not force the pulp to the bottom. Third - the taste. It is VERY VERY sweet, followed by the slimy pulp hitting your mouth and finally a bizarre aftertaste. When I say this stuff is loaded with sugar, I mean it. The Chantea is 11.5 ounces and is broken into two servings per bottle. That means there is 38 grams of sugar if you drink the entire bottle. A 12 ounce Dr Pepper has 38 grams of sugar and tastes better. If you are diabetic or concerned about sugar intake, steer clear! I won't buy this ever."
77595,B001LG940E,4.0,"The Black Cherry Switch is an interesting beverage, a cross between the traditional carbonated drinks and fruit juice. As some of the other reviewers have noted, this is a very sweet drink, and I say that as someone with a sweet tooth. Granted of course, black cherry is by definition a very sweet fruit.<br /><br />The 8.3oz can packs 130 calories, which mostly come from fruit juices, not corn syrup or sugar - according to the ingredients box. Interestingly, the box mentions that beyond cherry, there's also apple, acerola and grape juice concentrates in it.<br /><br />One big plus of this drink over traditional Colas is that it has 100% RDA Vitamin C (according to the product box).<br /><br />The can is environmentally responsible as it encourages the drinker to recycle this can, using the same font size as the rest of the text on the box.<br /><br />And a side note: In dealing with the extra sweetness, I tried this experiment: I diluted some of the drink with unflavored carbonated water using equal amounts. At that level, it had a much lighter taste and one that felt more like flavored carbonated water than carbonated juice.<br /><br />In my opinion, this drink should have about 2/3rds of its current ""sweetness"".<br /><br />Conclusion: If you like sweet carbonated drinks or if you are trying to get off the sugary or faux-sugar Colas, this is a lesser-evil alternative."

129078,B00008O35V,1.0,"We've been feeding this to our Great Dane and honestly it hasn't worked out too well.<br /><br />Our dog is just over a year old and at her annual vet visit the vet pointed out that she was developing a yeast infection in her ear.  He told me it was most likely from her food and asked what we feed her.  I told him we feed her IAMS Large Breed food, and he said that it was probably the problem.<br /><br />He said we didn't need to treat it at the level that it was at, but that if she got to where she was shaking her ears a lot, or pawing at them, or if we noticed other symptoms, we would want to try a better diet to see if it fixed it.<br /><br />So, our dog's ears got worse.  She was constantly shaking her ears.  Her skin developed really bad dandruff.  She used to be really obedient, but she became really naughty.  I called the vet's office and we're switching her to a wheat-free corn-free diet now.  Last week we transitioned her over and this week we have already seen a little improvement; she doesn't shake her ears much at all anymore.  We'll watch and see if the dandruff and behavior problems also go away.  I am hopeful that they will.<br /><br />Maybe some dogs can eat this and be fine--our dog LIKES eating IAMS food...but it's just really obvious that it hasn't been good for her.  Until her vet told me, I had no idea that dog foods have so much bad stuff in them.  Dogs are carnivores, so it makes sense that they have problems on a wheat and corn diet.  The vet didn't try to sell us any particular brand of food, he just suggested trying a wheat and corn free brand for a couple months to see how it goes.  We are trying Nutro Natural Choice now.<br /><br />Too bad.  $50-60/bag dog food for a Great Dane is going to add up."
249668,B001LGGH54,2.0,"I started drinking carbonated juice to replace energy drink because I mostly drank energy drinks for the taste, not the caffiene.  In that regard, carbonated juice drinks are a great substitute for replacing energy drinks if half of the reason you drank them was taste, like it was for me.  Otherwise a drink of this nature may not be right for you because it is loaded with more calories than a soda.  I drink grape juice on a regular basis which has (depending on the grape juice) about 40 grams of sugar and 170 calories, so in that regard this product is better.  haha  If you are a weight conscious person you just have to remember that juive has just as much, if not more, sugar than soda and is equally bad for your teeth.  The main difference between these types of drinks and regular soda is that the sugar is natural rather than process, which actually does make quite a difference because white sugar is well-known to cause weight gain, and I drink a lot of juice, and I lost weight because it actually cut my cravings.<br /><br />  So in terms of the taste of this product it was definitely a matter of taste.  The strawberry is a little bit overpowering, but if you like strawberry so, it probably wont bother you, the watermelon wasn't quite as strong, and if you are expecting this to be pure watermelon and strawberry juice forget it.  Like most sdrinks of this nature this is maybe %5 of the most expensive juice to produce and the rest is filler juice, ei apple and grape.  In defense of this product and other of this nature, I'm not sure pure watermelon and strawberry juice would actually taste good.<br /><br />  The carbonation in it was definitely lacking.  I prefer the Izze sparkling juice because they are very fizzy and not really sweet at all, they really do taste like pure carbonated juice, whereas this stuff taste like they boiled down the juice to maximize the sugar potency and mixed it in with a little carbonated water; its just not that good.<br /><br />  So it may be natural and slightly more healthy, but it wont make you lose you weight and it doesn't taste good enough to stave off any sugar craving, you run straight for a can of coke after this.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy"

Part of that problem may lie with the fact that the box sat in the sun for an hour in 90 degree heat after the mailperson delivered it.

As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine."

However, I have having a hard time finding a light roast decaf coffee that had the flavor that I wanted, so I reluctantly decided to spend the money on it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was how SMOOTH my cup of coffee was... very creamy.  I LOVED that.  Then the aftertaste kicked in; a strong, intriguing flavor that was not at all unpleasant. I don't know how to exactly describe it, but it did make me go back for a second cup; I wanted to try it iced too!  It was top notch iced with some chocolate; it has a strong enough flavor but in a light roast so you don't get that burnt flavor, but it REALLY stood out with the chocolate flavor with it.  It seemed to be very low acid as well, it didn't eat at my stomach the way that the Sumatra coffee I had been drinking lately had.<br /><br />I'm still not sure if I can justify the price of the coffee for the flavor, but I suspect I will be back for more!  The more I write about it the more I want to go brew up a cup... and although it's 8:30 in the evening, it IS decaf, so I can, right? :D"

That allows me to keep this review short and sweet, though maybe not as sweet as this drink. The Switch is a fruity, unique beverage. Carbonated juice is a good idea, but the overall flavor is weak and the quantity is small. This might still be good for making a break from the regular cola (or diet cola, or water, or sports drink, or whatever) drink rut, but I really can't picture too many people picking up cases of this to consume on a regular basis.

17567,B000CMIYWM,5.0,"OK, first--I don't write reviews unless a product REALLY stands out to me!  I'm a Queen of Amazon.com Prime and receive requests all the time to write reviews on the millions of products I order (how many people know all their delivery guys by their first names?) SO, with that said--Yogi Calming Tea is the BEST calming tea for me because of the FLAVOR. There are a lot of Chamomile teas in the world and all of them give me the calming effect; but, the flavor--EH? This is the one and only one I actually like--maybe it's the addition of lavender?  Do your own taste test and see if you like the difference. I couldn't find Yogi's Calming Tea for a while in my markets so today when it popped up on Amazon.com, I was thrilled!  I subscribed to the auto-ship and save program so I will never be out of it again-HOORAY!"
17505,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"Obviously, one's preference for coffee is a personal thing. I happen to like this particular coffee very much. It is strong enough, but not bitter. I bought two boxes on sale, but the regular price of the K-cups has been rising beyond the point that I will spend for a homemade cup of coffee. Instead, I have been using pods for the Senseo machines. I got an adaptor for the Keureg, and they work fine for less than half the price. I also have an adaptor for ground coffee, the cheapest alternative, so I always have lots of choices for coffee flavors."

Having just returned from a trip to Santa Fe where I had purchased it originally, I introduced him to the pleasures of morning hot chocolate.  He was hooked!!  Now for the other use, today , the day after Thanksgiving clean up we were at breakfast without any milk in the house, but an abundance of leftover decaf coffee from the celebration, his long face was brightened when I spooned in a bit of MOCAFE Mexican Spiced Chocolate into a cup of decaf.  WOW! a new taste and he loved it!<br /><br />What else can I say, it's a hit around our house."
162979,B000R4HQPG,3.0,"I haven't got mine yet, as I just ordered it.  But I am a huge fan of the Peach Green Tea from Bigelow.  That stuff is remarkable, it is simply green tea with real peach granules. That's it. No herbs.  No flowers.  No plants... ;  Just green tea and real peach!<br />I've heard people comment that the peach scent is so strong that you can smell it across a room.<br /><br />So I'm hoping that the Blueberry will be the same.  I've never really been disappointed by anything that I've tried from Bigelow, so I'm pretty hopeful.  If the Blueberry isn't that overpowering, that might be okay.  Blueberry can be really strong in flavor, so maybe the folks at Bigelow were just playing it safe - I dunno.<br /><br />But I'm looking forward to trying it soon."
77557,B001LG940E,4.0,"I tried this because I'm trying to give up pop and wanted something that was fizzy to drink.

I stuck with this food because, well, the dogs like it, but also because it's one of the few canned dog foods that don't cause either digestive or allergy issues with either of my 2 dogs. It's nice to have the mix of flavors so they're not eating the same flavor every morning. They eat this for breakfast then they eat the same brand of dry varieties the rest of the day. Seems like a nice, healthy diet."

Since her health is otherwise good, I do what I can just to make sure she stays healthy and is as comfortable as can be.<br /><br />She has been drinking the tea for a week now and says it is defintiely helping. Thank you! Anything I can do to keep her alive and comfortable is a good thing. She also says it tastes pretty good. And I like that it's not another medication to have in her body but is all natural. She likes drinking tea very day anyway and it's nice to be able to help her feel better."

80918,B0029JW9JU,4.0,"I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that ""practice makes perfect"".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days."
253501,B004JRMG98,2.0,"First of all I hate Mayo... any recipe that calls for mayo I substitute ranch dressing.  I like Mexican food and I love spicy things... but I don't eat fast food and especially don't go to taco bell.  I wasn't sure if I would like this sauce or not... but figured what the heck, I dig jalapenos.<br /><br />This is runny like a dressing but without the flavor... the flavoring reminded me of a very bland peppercorn ranch, the store brand.  I hated it on my tacos because it tasted too much like mayo.  We tried it as a chip dip but it was too bland to add anything but moisture to the chips.  I couldn't figure out what to use it for until I made some chicken salad, and rather than subbing ranch, I subbed this stuff.  It was alright, made for a nice change but isn't anything I would ever buy again.<br /><br />I didn't sense any jalapeno flavoring to this, it really tasted like a cheap discount brand ranch dressing.  It was not spicy so I would guess some people may like it on a sandwich.  After reading the label I discovered there was no health benefit to subbing this for ranch or mustard so you would just really have to like the flavor.<br /><br />This wasn't to my flavor."

136023,B005SPQENY,1.0,"I am a huge fan of healthy products for overall good nutrition. I was intrigued by the Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea, passion fruit flavor.  Made with cane sugar, water, green tea infusion, aloe vera, citric acid, and natural flavors, it doesn't have any artificial ingredients. With only 19g of sugar per serving, it is a much better choice than high sugary fruit juices or soda. On appearance, it looks peculiar with bits of aloe floating around in the bottle; however, I decided to give it a try.  Surprisingly, it has a fresh taste. Unfortunately, the bits of aloe, while healthy, made me gag. Also, the particles of aloe were stuck in my teeth after swallowing the drink.  I had to rinse my mouth out with water.  For that, I do not recommend this drink."
148718,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"You only get 5 bars in a box so the price comes out to almost .60 cents a bar, that's expensive.  Especially when it's just a glorified PayDay candy bar.  It does have 7g. of protein but also 22g. of carbs. so it's not a diet bar and it's not a low-carb bar.  It also doesn't compare to a nut and granola bar, the granola in this bar looked like oats covered in a sugar glaze.<br /><br />It tasted good on the start but by the finish it had a fake, burnt peanut taste, almost like rancid oil.  Apparently my box had gotten too hot because the coating of peanut butter that is on the bottom of the bar had melted and it was a mess inside the wrapper.  This would not be kid friendly in the car.  It would be a great big mess.<br /><br />I would pass on these for the cost and nutritional information alone.  But then combined with the peanut butter coating on the bottom (!) it's definitely a no-go."

167672,B006BXUZVO,3.0,I like Rasin Bran cereal normally so when I saw this new flavor I thought that I would give it a try.  I am not really a fan of almonds but there are not alot of them so they were not overwhelming.  The cinnamon flavor could have been a bit more pronouced for my taste since I really do like cinnamon.  The cereal stayed crunchy in the bowl and didn't get soggy.  I did find the almonds a bit hard for my liking (yes I know they are nuts but they were a bit hard for me).  The cereal left a slight aftertaste in my mouth.  It wasn't a bad aftertaste but an aftertaste none the less.  I may get this cereal again if I have a coupon for it but I doubt I would buy it at regular price.
77888,B001LG940E,4.0,"My family and I recently tasted this Switch drink (as well as the Strawberry Kiwi) flavor.  I found the cherry taste: noticeable taste without being overpowering.  My husband did not agree with me and thought the Kiwi flavor was better.<br /><br />I did find this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.  It would probably be delicious in a mixed drink or with lemon-lime soda as a spritzer, but I didn't have any hand to try it out.<br /><br />Although I found it flavorful, I probably would not buy this drink, and especially not as a substitute for soft drink for the kids."

130786,B004B3KHEG,1.0,"This product did not meet our expectations.  The pieces were not light and crisp as I expected but were somewhat chewy and odd shaped.

236112,B004OP74HE,2.0,"While these taste good, they are far too messy. I am consistently challenged by them in attempting to avoid both (1) getting crumbling granola all over my desk and floor and (2) having the chocolate melt all over my fingers. I have had granola bars my whole life and I am well aware of the crumbs they can generate--but these bars will send granola flying just by opening the wrapper and the chocolate on these bars melts instantly upon any bodily contact (like fingers). I bought these as a snack of convenience, which they most definitely are not."

Since they had a deal on this flavored one, I figured I'd try it. Bad call. It tastes so bad, that I'm debating just tossing it all out. I've even had two friends try it, and neither one liked it - wondering if it went bad, or was meant to taste bad.<br /><br />Moral of the story?

79200,B001TJTFSE,4.0,"The primary use for this product is as an emulsifier.  It does work for that, but one of the side effects is that it can be used to create frothy foam that is fairly stable.

It is expensive, but a little goes a long long way."
17177,B000EH0RU2,5.0,"This is a great blend for those who do not like just the brown rice by itself. It is also tasty when you cook it with salt and butter. I've also tried adding dried cranberries and peanuts to give it a different flavor...yummy! It is a healthier alternative over the regular white rice. Although it is pricier than regular white rice, buying it from Amazon in bulk reduces the cost per container. I've seen it in the standard markets for over $7 each. My only gripe about cooking brown rice is that it takes longer to cook than regular white rice. However, I do recommend this mix to anyone looking for a healthier way to eat!"
160260,B0005YWH2U,3.0,"Franks is a diluted/mild hot sauce containing cayenne pepper along with a fairly heavy dose of vinegar. If you are just looking for a hot sauce that can be liberally applied then Franks might hit the mark, assuming you like this much vinegar.  The diluted nature of Franks makes it quite forgiving.<br /><br />However, you could purchase a small bottle of Tabasco (5 oz) and dilute it and achieve the same results. Better yet - buy a ""small"" bottle (17 oz is their smallest size) of Huy Fong Sriracha Chili Sauce ($6.00) and add a lot of water and you'll have a diluted hot sauce that tastes much better, at a fraction of the cost of Franks.<br /><br />While the name hardly rolls of the tongue - Huy Fong Sriracha Chili Sauce - is better than Tabasco or Franks! You can make gallons of diluted hot sauce for a fraction of the price that Franks charges and it will taste far better too.<br /><br />If you are the least bit curious then I suggest you try something else. You might be pleasantly surprised. Obviously, no reviewer can encompass the myriad of tastes that Amazon customers have. What a reviewer can do is suggest alternatives that might appeal to others.<br /><br />Try one of these:<br /><br />a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic.  Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section!<br /><br />b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section<br /><br />c) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br />d) Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce - a well know national brand. The Chipotle pepper is smoked and has a unique flavor. Commonly available but the taste of this smoked pepper is not for everyone.<br /><br />e) El Yacateco Green<br /><br />A good hot sauce might begin with Franks but it hardly ends there. I'd give Franks 2 stars, Tabasco 2 stars and the others listed 4 or 5 stars.<br /><br />I can't encourage you enough to experiment and enjoy the process!!!!<br /><br />PS: There are a number of people who have settled on a single product (such as Franks) and hate the fact that anyone might suggest an alternative. These customers view any Amazon review that contradicts their beliefs as threatening and down rate it accordingly. That is unfortunate."

When I first got tasted it strait, was shocked at the resemblence to wheat grass juice and the bitterness that lingers in the back of your throat.  Compared to my regular store bought EVOO's heaviness and richness, this one is clean and bright.  But my first reaction was to write the seller and find out if my bottle tasted as it should or if I'd gotten a bad bottle.  They wrote back saying that the grassy flavor and ""peppery notes"" (bitterness, in my book) comes from the relatively young olives.  I was also impressed by the fact that I got this in Sept and it was bottled as recently as August, probably also responsible for the fresh taste.  Getting this olive oil inspired me to try some other brands and I have found a very similar taste without the bitterness in the slightly less exensive Trader Joe's Australian variety of EVOO.  Both are great when used in fresh dishes and shine best when they aren't cooked.  My biggest question is, why aren't people reviewing more EVOO products on Amazon.  The fact that this one is the only one who's following sings it's praises here should tell you that it's worth trying."

To be perfectly honest, a can of bumblebee tuna would be better than this and it would cost you 35 less dollars, I only purchased it by mistake and the seller immediately hit the shipping soon button and would not stop shipment even after request.  Worst transaction I've had on Amazon to date.<br /><br />I couldn't even stomach to taste it, that's how bad the smell was, huge waste of money, just go to the store and get a filet yourself, cheaper and better quality."

The aroma of this product clung to my hair for the whole day.<br /><br />I did  seem to see less hair in my  comb as I was combing my hair out after my shower and my comb ran through my hair quite easily.<br />But even after thorough rinsing my hair felt greasier than it did silky. When dry my hair did not have the usual manageability that I normally do with my OTC 'Nexus' products."

Every now and then there would be a delicious one, but most were tough and not very tasty. I wound up mixing them with chopped dates and raisins to make them more palatable, otherwise I was tempted to throw most out. Needless to say, I'll never buy them again."
167354,B007PE7ANY,3.0,"Essentially this product is nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews and walnuts) glued together with honey and a bit of sugar.<br /><br />None of the ingredients is particularly unhealthy.  I'd rate it higher except the taste is only ""so so"".  It does provide more fiber than sugar so that is very good.  And of course the easy to carry packaging makes it a good choice for travel (or taking to work).<br /><br />Good product, unremarkable flavor.<br /><br />Edit: I should point out that I'm reviewing the ""Madagascar Vanilla Almond"" product, the other flavors sound more interesting."
137276,B000KSTYBS,1.0,"I've purchased this product twice.  First time was back in 2007, as a birthday gift for my sister.  She loved it.  She sent me a couple ounces to try and I too thought it was great, maybe the best coffee I have ever tried.  I drink coffee but am by no means a gourmet and I don't buy expensive coffees for my self.  I purchased another order (a couple weeks ago) as a gift for my housemate.  I can't believe its the same coffee.  It tastes like the Folgers or Maxwell House I buy at my local grocery.  It has a bitter aftertaste.  I'll be the first to admit I don't know anything about fancy coffee; but when we opened the package the beans looked wet with oil.  We transferred the beans to other containers and the inside of the package was lined with beans stuck on by the oil.  The beans weren't dripping oil but almost.  Is this right for fancy coffee?  Needless to say I am disappointed."

Emma (Pres) relayed the shipment would go out immediately and apologized for the delay. Thought it was done...  A few moments later, Anna calls back and goes into some diatribe with my wife not knowing what coffee is.  If the president of the company resolved the issue, why is someone else from the company calling to stir it up?!<br /><br />Another call back to speak with Emma and she apologized for the actions of Anna.

123520,B000VMBE8E,1.0,"I have been an avid fan of these cookies for years.  My family went through dozens of boxes a month for our use, taking to functions as our donation, giving as gifts.  They were a dark, rich, wholesome, deep taste experience.  In May, 2012, I couldn't find them on the shelf in any of our normal stores.  After a few weeks, they were back.  I took them home and opened them and was surprised to find that the inside container was different.  It used to be three rows that ran the short end of the box.  Now it was two rows that ran the long end of the box.  No big deal had that been all that changed.  I took a cookie out and popped it in my mouth expected the same dark, rich, wholesome experience, and the cookie tasted so bad I almost threw up.  It was sickly sweet.  It tasted like a combination between an oreo and a health food bar.  All they did was move to the middle ground where those who like health food bars won't like the oreo sweet taste and those who like oreos won't like the health food bar taste.  They are awful.  And, I'm so sad, because before they changed the formulation, these were the best cookies on the market.  I turned so many people on to them.  Now that they changed the recipe, none of us will ever be buying them again.  They are now the worst cookie I have ever tasted."
75869,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I've tried a few of the energy drinks. Some are pretty good, some are Yuk! Some worked while a lot didn't. Now this one, it works. It gave me a good kick in the backside to get me going and tasted pretty good too. It did have an unusual flavor that I can't really describe, other than to say it was something different and I liked it. I only had one can of it to try and its kinda hard to be more specific from just that. I've looked for it in the stores around here where I live in Colorado but haven't found any yet. At $28 for a 12 pack, that's really high for me and way out of my price range. There's several energy drinks out on the market now and a lot of them are priced far below these. If they bring the price down then I'd think about buying some more to try out.<br />  Over all, this one gave me a good lift to get me going. It did give me a small dose of the jitters and my hands a minor case of the shakes for a little while at first. Or as some people would say, a slight case of the tremors. But that calmed down after a little while and I got a lot more done around here than I usually do. I suppose that jittery feeling and shaking hands, or tremors, would go away if you used this regularly and got used to it.<br /> I don't have any problem with recommending this No Fear, Super Energy Supplement.

161410,B004W55ZBI,3.0,"I purchased these mostly out of curiosity--I  never purchase cookies of any kind, and especially not the gluten-free variety (taste, texture, ingredients, price...just not worth it).  Before I review the cookies themselves I should explain that I almost never purchase processed food.  (I grind my own flours, make my own crackers, granola, salad dressings, etc.  So my three young daughters were SO excited to try something out of a box...whatever!  The grass is always greener on the other side!)  Anyway, I had seen these a few times at my local health food store and thought I'd give them a try.  If you're looking for gourmet, keep looking, these aren't your cookies.  However, for a boxed, gluten-free cookie they aren't too bad.  The fig flavor is more honest than a fig newton (haven't had in years but never liked), and they aren't as overly sweet as some.  That said, the fig flavor isn't quite strong enough to mask the typical gluten-free flavor of the cookie itself, and as other reviewers have noted they are very crumbly.  I ate the two in my little package and two of my three daughters ate theirs.  (One thought they were okay-good, the other said they were okay.)  The two year old tossed hers over the side of her carseat.  No one asked for more.<br />Honestly, in a pinch I still would not buy them again, but if you like fig newtons and don't want to make your own AND you must buy gluten-free...well, these aren't too bad."

238068,B0006FLWXS,2.0,"I purchased a case of Genova Tonno Olive Oil tuna due to the reviews I have read and I am very sorry I did.  I was looking for a tuna with no soy broth or MSG and this brand caught my eye.  The cans are very small snack sized which is fine, but they have a strange pop-top lid that is inset deep so that you can use a can opener on it as well, I suppose in the event the pop top doesn't work.  The pop tops are very hard to open but they have never failed.<br /><br />When they say they contain salt they are not kidding.  It is almost inedible unless you mix plenty of mayonaise or other ingredients which is something I wanted to avoid.  The first can was so salty it was actually humorous, but after 3 cans of super salty tuna it was no longer funny.  Perhaps they need to over-salt the tuna as a preservative or maybe it was a goof up at the packing plant.  All I know is this is the saltiest tuna I have ever eaten.  I would liken it to oversalted potato chips at the bottom of the bag you may throw out rather than eat.<br /><br />When I made a tuna salad with eggs, mayo, and other ingredients it was actually okay, so if you are brave enough to order a case in hopes of it won't be salty, then go ahead.  The solid pack texture of the tuna is excellent and it is so firm that you have to dig it out with a fork. You can't turn it over and plop it out in a bowl.<br /><br />The beautiful label, olive oil, and lack of preservatives or additives made this tuna very appealing to me, but the salt is rediculous and you can't even taste the olive oil."

That said, it's only about as good as you'd expected for stuff marketed in the name of the cheapest fast food joint in the multiverse.<br /><br />I can see this stuff being helpful in seriously watering down an overly spicy batch of burrito beef or something, but really it's no better suited for that than sour cream, which is much cheaper. Also, this stuff tastes a little plasticky and caots your throat in a very unpleasant manner.<br /><br />If they have little squeezey packets of this at Taco Bell, I might use a bit of it on my next chalupa. Otherwise, it's eminently forgettable."
244294,B001E52XGO,2.0,Thews might be OK in a real pinch. The flavor is OK. they are so skimpy on the meat though. I would rather pay another buck and get a few bites of meat with the meal. They are filled up with lots of gravy and maybe four bites of meat. They are pretty sad meals. Military MRE's and significantly better in most cases. I have tried several of the varieties. The issues are all the same. A great deal of sauce and hardly any meat. It is edible. Hardly satisfying.

253190,B001EQ4IES,2.0,"I'm not very happy with this coffee.  It is bitter and astringent, and the aroma is odd. The aroma is harsh and smells of bitter citrus.  I got this coffee to try as a replacement for the exorbitantly overpriced Starbucks VIA Ready-brew instant coffee. The Nescafe is not nearly as good as the Starbucks instant coffee unfortunately. The Starbucks VIA is smooth, has a pleasing aroma, and tastes pretty similar to Starbucks drip coffee. It also dissolves easier than Nescafe, since it is a finely ground powder instead of crystals.<br /><br />I recommend avoiding this coffee or trying the Original blend instead of Gourmet roast. Also, regarding the other reviewers who said this coffee is not available in local stores, their reviews may be outdated or they live in weird places. This coffee is available in most of my local grocery stores."

76945,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"There are 3 main styles of granola:<br />1) Hard and crunchy (aka the broken-up granola bar), good for single-hand snacking and on-the-go snacking.  Firm and won't fall apart in your hands.<br /><br />2) Chewy (broken up cookie/dense cake type), good for snacking but can be sticky and messy. Usually need more than one hand to eat this.<br /><br />3) Crumbly, mainly good for cereal, shot-glass style snacking or sprinkling over yogurt and ice cream.<br /><br />This product is the 3rd type: small crisp crumbly clusters the size of large popcorn, but also a lot of little bits in the bag.  The little bits account for a little over 1/3 of the product in the bag. (See uploaded photo)<br /><br />Taste:<br />The product is a not too sweet granola with small thin chocolate bits evenly distributed in it.  The small chocolate bits melt nicely on your tongue and there is no excessive chewing of large hard chocolate chunks or worse, chocolate sprinkles, powders or coating on the granola. Simple granola + chocolate bits in the right size. The chocolate is a decent but not spectacular dark semi-sweet chocolate that isn't crunchy but melts on contact with your tongue.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The bag is resealable, but the tear-off strip was messy and ineffective. I had to use scissors.<br /><br />You could easily make something just like this at home, but this product's main selling point is the size and consistency of the chocolate bits.  Also, packaged granola is convenient.<br /><br />Good for those who like sweet breakfasts and snacks and for those who like chocolate with their granola but don't like the hard chunks of chocolate they usually have.  It would also make a semi-healthy snack for kids (who don't mind dark chocolate) using the jello-cup method. I would not recommend this for on-the-go snacking because it is rather crumbly and the chocolate melts easily. I would also not recommend this for milk chocolate lovers. For those who live in the warmer parts of the country and for the upcoming summer months, the chocolate might melt during transport.<br /><br />Granola is to oats what a Caramel Latte is to milk: a very tasty spin on something healthy by making it less so, but in the end it is still made from something healthy and better than candy or cola."

If you have ever tried to reuse a k-cup you'll understand what this coffee tastes like.  I did an experiment weighing five different brands of coffee and found all to be 1/2 oz. or more except Brooklyn and it weighed one tenth of an ounce.  That's 1/5 the weight of Dunkin' Donuts, Newman's Own, Millstone and 1/6 the weight of Starbucks.  This is the second time I've ordered coffee from Amazon and found it to be lacking.  Since they won't take returns, (even from prime members) I don't think I'll order any more coffee from Amazon in the future.  The reason I titled this review the second worst coffee was because I got tricked into buying a coffee that was really just instant coffee in a k-cup cartridge.

123558,B000VMBE8E,1.0,"I was attracted to this box of cookies because of the ""brand"". ""Late July"" sounds like a wonderful brand name, and late July does bring back wonderful memories for me: it sounds like a fish fry with homemade french-fried potatoes and cole slaw and hush puppies, an ice bucket, iced tea, a cool breeze blowing from the fan, a porch, and lots of love. That's what I thought of when I saw this brand. Also, it is natural and therefore, vegans can have this product.<br /><br />Vanilla bean with green tea:  The cookies didn't taste good. The flavor idea was pretty good. There was a hint of good flavor. Vanilla bean with green tea sounds wonderful. Possibly, the bad taste was due to all the soy and soy products used.  I managed to eat this whole box (of vanilla bean with green tea) without throwing any out.<br /><br />Dark chocolate:  Horrible.  I couldn't even finish the whole box; I had to throw out most of it.  (And I'm the queen of conservativeness.)  The ""dark"" chocolate was so dark and so horrible, that it was too much for even a chocolate lover.  The chocolate had a horrible taste.  Not to mention the horrible taste it left in your mouth.  (Possibly too much soy, and whatever was in that chocolate.)  I literally had to go and buy some lemons and ate two, and also some potato chips, just to get that taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />Never again."

It's been several years since I bought this coffee, and I'm not near a supermarket, so I can't give you the name of the other ingredient....but I do remember it started with an ""M"".

However, the label STILL proclaims how ""smooth"" this coffee is, so I suspect it's the same one I hurriedly bought without looking at he label, several years ago.  My advice:  Look At The Label.  Of thi coffee....of every coffee, and of everything else you buy, in the supermarkt or out of it.<br /><br />Nestles makes the excellent ""Taster's Choice"" Coffee line.  EVERY one of these coffees is totally superb.  And every one of them is also 100% coffee.  If you really want a ""coffee blend"", do what I do -- mix the various Taster's Choice Coffees, (and Maxwell House Instant, and any other intant ccffees you happen to have around the house, togther.  Place in a large cannister, (usually used for flower or sugar), and shake or stir.  THAT is a blend of ALL COFFEE!<br />100%.  I sadly suspect that Nestle's ""Mountain-Blend"" coffee, is still NOT a coffee blend, nor is it 100% coffee.  Go the supermarket, check the label, and see!  :("
77554,B001LG940E,4.0,"I am a moderate drinker of both sodas and juices, so I was intrigued by the promise of The Switch.  I would receive the vitamin benefits of my juices with the fizzy fun of a soda.  The can is slim, so it fits nicely in my lunch bag but would rattle around in my car cup holder if I decided to take it as a to-go breakfast drink.  Once I had it all nice and chilled, I popped the top and listed to the fizz.  It was not quite the satisfying pop and fizz of a Coca-Cola, but that is because this drink has less carbonation.  When I took a sip, I was immediately transported back to grade school field trips where we were given bag lunches with juice boxes.  While it was a nice moment of nostalgia, the novelty quickly wore off.  The juice was nice, but I am not sure the carbonation really added anything to it.<br /><br />My biggest concern really deals more with the people who may not do their due diligence before deciding to purchase this product.  If you have a soda addiction, but you drink diet soda, this would be a calorie explosion.  While it is natural juice, you must remember that natural juice is high in sugar.  If you are accustomed to guzzling three or four sodas per day (or more) then you would not want to replace them with this beverage.  It must be approached with the same dietary caution as you would use with regular juice.  But if you have difficulty drinking juice or getting your recommended fruit servings each day, this might be a fun alternative.<br /><br />The price is high compared to soda, but it is low compared to some other individually bottled/canned juices.  I thought that the black cherry flavor was a little weak compared to my expectations.  I preferred the kiwi/berry flavor.  I think that it makes a nice treat, but it is not going to be complete substitute for me."

16573,B000RJARJS,5.0,"This is the same Turkish tea you can drink in kebab establishments in Europe. It's typically served in tiny, tulip-shaped glasses on small saucers. On a cold day, it's really warming, and it's even refreshing in summer.<br /><br />This tea is brewed in a two-part teapot, typically stainless steel with a big pitcher below for hot water and a smaller teapot on top for brewing a strong infusion of the tea. You set the teapot on top of the hot water to brew, then use the hot water to dilute the tea to desired strength. This is similar to the way Russian tea is brewed in a samovar.<br /><br />One thing about this tea; there is a lot of tea leaf dust in the package. To avoid a sort of off flavor contributed by the dust, it's easy to wash the leaves before brewing. I put the tea into a tea strainer, pour hot water over the leaves and discard the water. The leaves go into the pot for brewing. This really improves the flavor. It's not unusual to ""wash"" tea leaves; in China, tea is often made by throwing off the first water infusion and quickly re-infusing the wet leaves.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea is more like Russian or China black tea--less snappy and tannic than Assam or Darjeeling."

81886,B005CUU25G,4.0,"What a great idea for a treat.  Lickety Stik is constructed like a roll-on deodorant with a flavored dog treat inside.  Hold the Stik upside down and my dog licked away at it.  It is low calorie (great for my dog who is on a diet). It is also very easy to carry.  I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket. It makes a great little reward during training sessions.<br /><br />I find it especially helpful to reward my dog when Im teaching him a new trick. With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport. However it does mean that if it is your primary treat for you dog, you may run out quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I can say that the dog was enthusiastic about the stick. It was easy to use. It was fun to give. I am happy with this product."

I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is ""healthy"", and would argue against it being ""edible"".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks."

I prepared it exactly as instructed on the jar (2 TBS PB2 powder + 1 TBS water) and it was amazing - more like natural PB without all of the oil and less sweetness than store brands. They add just the right amount of sugar to this product. The total ingredients are peanuts, salt and sugar. 45 cals for 2 TBS. Also, I tried this in Greek yogurt (1 TBS to one container of yogurt) and it was really good and peanuty! You have to try it to believe it. I'm going to try the chocolate version next.

The flavors are delicious, especially with honey. I also suffer from gastrointestinal issues and it hasn't really helped in that respect, though....but I'm on some Crohn's level issues.

It tastes like a mixed berry drink to me, and it goes down nice and smooth.  There's no overly harsh taste from caffeine or carbonation like I've gotten from other drinks.  For me, it's something that I would enjoy in the afternoon but not early in the morning, though, so it isn't my choice for an early morning pick-me-up.  Since I drink caffeine in the morning and not in the afternoon, I ""like"" but don't ""love"" this stuff.<br /><br />As for the description on Amazon, it's incorrect at the time of this review.  I'd never had No Fear before and wasn't familiar with it, but the good reviews enticed me to try it.  What also enticed me was Amazon's description that it's sugar free.  While there is a sugar free version (which I noticed after ordering this), this one definitely is not - there are 66 grams of sugar per can.  That's not a cut against the product at all, but had I known that, I wouldn't have ordered this version.<br /><br />If you like sugary drinks and are looking for a sweet energy drink, this is very good stuff and worth giving a try.<br /><br />******************<br />The nutrition facts weren't available when I bought mine, so here's a listing:<br /><br />Serving size:  8 oz<br />Servings per container:  2<br /><br />The following are the amount per serving:<br />- Calories = 130<br />- Carbs = 34g<br />- Sugars = 33g<br />- Vitamin C = 100% DV (DV = ""Daily Value"")<br />- Vitamin B6 = 100% DV<br />- Folic Acid = 10% DV<br />- Vitamin B12. = 100% DV<br />- Zinc = 10% DV<br />- Selenium = 10% DV<br />- Sodium = 4% DV<br />- Potassium = 1% DV<br /><br />Proprietary Blend<br />- Taurine = 1000mg<br />- Inositol = 100mg<br />- Caffeine = 87mg<br />- Panax ginseng Root Extract = 50mg<br />- Guarana Seed Extract = 50mg<br />- Grape Seed Extract = 25mg<br />- L-Camitine = 25mg<br />- L-Arginin = 25mg"

The nuts are expensive and I thought I was getting a good value with Azar but as it turns out, since the Azar Chinese pine nuts are not edible for me, they were a tremendous waste.<br /><br />Perhaps not every body will have the same reaction as I but I thought I must still flag a warning about Chinese pine nuts.<br /><br />I should add finally that I do NOT have any problems with domestic pine nuts or Italian pignolias and I much prefer them, especially if they are organically grown.

We love our dogs and they deserve the best food available. Personally I use only raw for my dog but thought he might like a change so I tried a few different kinds.  This is not as bad as some so I will use it for training since it is hard and not to greasy and I do not feed my dog large amounts.<br /><br />My dog does seem to like it but it is not going to be part of his mealtime.  Something I noticed on the label is a reference to feeding our dogs once a day, may I caution you, I used to feed my dog once a day until I found out that, that causes bloat.  Bloat is a very painful condition that only some dogs get when they seem to eat too fast, this is also due to the one a day feeding they seem not to be able to get enough. Please feed your dog twice per day.<br /><br />I do not feel this is a very good food for your dog.  Dogs are generally not made to deal with so much grain they are carnivores and do much better on a diet almost completely meat and bones. According to Peta some of these dry foods are the remains of dead and sick animals as eluded to in the later review.  I will stick to the diet I put my boy on.  I suggest you keep looking for something better.<br /><br />I am sure some of us do not eat the best food all the time and sometimes will eat bacon and eggs and a twinkie now and again and that is fine and it will not kill us and this food, on ocassion, will not kill our dogs but please do not feed them a food like this on a regular diet.<br /><br />We have our dogs for such a short time why not feed them quality food to keep them around longer."

But one big caveat: If you get a Tall or Grande at Starbucks, one K-cup is not going to a good substitute. The largest setting on a Keurig platinum is 12oz, which is a Tall in Starbucks lingo. I've enjoyed this at 8oz, but too much of a sacrifice at larger settings. What this means is I typically need 2 K-cups for my morning fix.

17082,B003CH4Q5I,5.0,"When I ordered this product, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I kind of had in mind a ""curry ketchup"" (literally just ketchup with a curry aftertaste), but the description made me think that wasn't quite on the mark.  But since I've been happy with Maya Kaimal's other products, and as a lover of both Indian food and ketchup, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />My suspicion that this wouldn't just be ""ketchup plus some curry flavor"" was borne out.  Honestly, it's a little difficult to describe.  It's as though someone scrapped the idea of ketchup and decided to start over and build a new ketchup out of some new ingredients and some old ones.  That's a weird description, I know, so I'll go into a little more detail.  It's just that nearly every ketchup you buy is basically slight variations on a theme.  This is different, but still identifiably ketchup.<br /><br />The spicy ketchup isn't smooth like most ketchups; it has a definite texture to it.  It's very slightly thicker than most ketchups, but not so much that you use it any differently.  It's not as tart as ketchup tends to be, nor as sweet as some (particularly ones that use sugar instead of HFCS).  It has a pleasant tomato flavor with a hint of smokiness and a definite Indian flair.  But all of the flavors are very, very integrated.  Like I said before, this isn't ""ketchup plus.""  It has a very unified, if complex, flavor.  And for those who are worried about the ""spicy"" part of the name, this ketchup has a little bit of bite to it, about as much heat as a one-star curry.<br /><br />I've tried it on a variety of different foods that I normally eat with ketchup and I admit my success has been mixed.  I tried it first with some fast food french fries, which was decidedly underwhelming.  It wasn't bad; it's just that it was more novel than good.  I tried it later with tater tots, which was much better.  I've had it on an ordinary cheeseburger, which was good but it didn't wow me like it wowed one of my friends.  But the two biggest successes I've had with it have been the most surprising.<br /><br />One, this ketchup is excellent on a hot dog.  Yes, I know you aren't ""supposed"" to put ketchup on hot dogs, but I don't like mustard or relish and I don't always want a chili dog.  And for what it's worth, I think the spicy Indian ketchup actually ""goes with"" hot dogs better than ordinary ketchup (which isn't to say I like it more, per se, just that the flavors seem more complementary).<br /><br />And two, I just tried this ketchup tonight on some black pepper and bleu cheese hamburgers I picked up at the store.  Again, I didn't expect much but tried it on a whim.  Amazing.  The black pepper really brought out the spiciness of the ketchup.  And the pockets of bleu cheese in the burgers... I really did not expect bleu cheese to go well with Indian-themed ketchup, but the combination was just incredible.  A stronger bleu cheese might not work as well, but this was fairly mild.<br /><br />I've tried a few different variant ketchups in the past (did I mention I really like ketchup?), but I rarely find anything that's worth getting again.  Not only am I glad I bought this bottle of spicy Indian ketchup, but when it's gone I plan on buying another.  I still use my Heinz, mind you.  The two ketchups are not interchangeable.  But they do seem to be good on largely the same things, and the spicy Indian ketchup is great for adding just a bit of flair to your food.  Highly recommend."

17168,B000EH0RU2,5.0,"I love the RiceSelect blends.  I have tried four of them including this Royal Blend and find each of them unique, adaptable and delicious.

I brought a casserole with this blend to a potluck supper and every single grain and berry was gone at the end.  It was a big hit.  If you want to try something different from regular brown or white rice, give RiceSelect Royal Blend a whirl.  I'm betting you enjoy every morsel."

246830,B003C5RLGG,2.0,"Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Bison was formerly the food of choice that I bought for my dogs (along with their Sweet Potato and Venison food).  I have a five-year-old Boxer and this was one of the only foods I could find that completely agreed with him.  He has never had any allergy conditions with Natural Balance and, with the Bison and Venison formulas, his stool has always been solid.  I recently added a German Shepherd puppy to the house and he has had similar results with Natural Balance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Natural Balance recently decided to jack up their prices by over ten dollars a bag and I can no longer justify buying it when I go through almost three bags a month.  Quite simply, charging almost seventy dollars for twenty-eight pounds of dog food is just ridiculous, particularly when you're going through a bag every two weeks.  I barely pay that much for my own groceries every two weeks.<br /><br />As such, I guess it's time to move on to other brands.  The first on my list is Taste of the Wild.  We'll see how that goes.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't support a company that jacks up their prices without increasing their quality."

I am a total newbie to the burst of energy you're supposed to get with these new fad drinks. So here is what happened when I tried this product.<br /><br />I waited until I was dragged down and tired. Side bar: I am fit and active, and am rarely tired. Continuing, the day I was dragged down, I drank 1/2 of the can and had to stop because the flavor repulsed me. I forced myself to drink it so I could see if it worked or not. After about five minutes of downing 1/2 of it, I definitely felt a surge of energy. I got to my feet and continued my day with the energy I like to have all the time. I did not notice that the effect died off; I seemed to feel fine the rest of the day (approx from noon to bedtime).<br /><br />So I think this product does what it says. I just wish it tasted better.

It would be nice to have a ""go-to"" type safe and tasty energy drink for the times when a cup of coffee just won't cut it.  Enter No Fear.  I immediately liked the taste of this stuff.  It slightly reminded me a an non-alcoholic non-energy drink I used to drink when if was around 12 to 15 years old which was called ""Apple Beer"".  Basically it had a nice grape/apple base with good fizz and so does No Fear.  No Fear gave me a noticeable lift after I drank half of the can.  I did not need to actually consume the entire can to get the benefit and, as mentioned, I liked the taste.  If it wasn't fairly high in calories I would not hesitate to consume the entire can at one time (this could be a help if after strenuous activity you were feeling shaky and needed some fuel/calories).<br /><br />All told, a tasty energy drink that delivers what the category promises:  a real noticeable lift without making you gag.  I would buy this stuff."

240379,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"We have a 5 year old mixed breed dog who weighs about 85 pounds on good days.  Frankly, she has had a rough time of it.  She caught the very tail end of the dog food crisis, ended up with kidney problems that rear their ugly heads now and then, and has become the world's pickiest dog food eater.  Chances are good that if she will eat any given dog food, it is a 50-50 proposition as to whether or not her kidneys will act up.  As a result, Miss Ted's people have tried any number of dog foods - the cheap stuff, the expensive stuff, the special diet stuff, the stuff from Walmart, the stuff from the grocery store, the stuff from the pet store, the stuff from the vet, even the refrigerated stuff, so I was happy to be given a chance to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>.<br /><br />The bag arrived beautifully packaged and unlike his normal habit of simply leaving things on the porch, the UPS driver carried this all the way upstairs for  me.  (I  was very grateful.) Miss Ted happened to be in one of her ""that stuff is poison and I'm not going to touch it so I'll just eat the cat's food until I can get into the pantry for some real people food"" mood, so her bowl remained untouched.  We tried another half-dozen times over a period of 10 days or so and got the same reaction every time. The dog food looks fine and smells fine, but Miss Ted won't eat Beneful - even if she hasn't eaten anything but the cat food in a couple of days.<br /><br />Others have pointed out some of the controversy surrounding this particular dog food, as well as the low rating given to the product by the Dog Food Advisor due to the high fat and carbohydrate levels.<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02:  if you are feeding strays like Grandma did out West, then this might be a good option and having the dog food delivered is a fantastic service.

My advice is to buy one single bottle at your local store.

For those who are not a fan of the meatballs, I find that they are better when they break up in the sauce and you are just left with a crumbly, chewy texture overall.  That being said, this $2.50+ per can is a steep price to pay (plus, like I said, you don't rurally want to eat too often- it may be organic, but it's sure not health food).  Also, if you have the opportunity,  Whole Foods has numerous store brand versions of Annie's products.  They all seem pretty much the same to me, and they are a good deal cheaper."
253423,B004JRMG98,2.0,"Do your lettuce a favor...don't inflict this dressing on it.  The taste is not fresh, and the texture is kind of slimy. It was too salty for me, and I'm the girl who puts salt on salted potato chips. You actually can taste a little of the jalapeno flavor and there is a bit of heat, but other than that, this is a glorified version of that packaged onion dip we used to gobble up when we were in college...you know, the one that went so well with the Anne Greensprings Berry Frost.<br /><br />I don't know what foods this ""sauce"" should be poured on or over. It turns a salad into a salty, slimy mess.  I tried it as a dip for carrots, celery and corn chips.  It did not improve any of them. I even schlepped out to the nearest tacqueria and ordered one cabeza and one al pastor.  The lady behind the counter ""tsk tsked"" me for ignoring her fresh salsa--so full of chopped fresh jalapenos and onion and tomato and cilantro, the smell alone had passersby falling to their knees in silent adoration.  Anyway I dolloped on the Taco Bell sauce, took one bite and apologized to the poor cow who's noggin I was munching for desecrating her sacrifice.  The nice lady behind the counter clonked me on the hand with a very heavy ladle when I tried to pour the Taco Bell stuff on the the al Pastor, so I used her fresh sauce instead. It was so good, I went cross-eyed for about three hours and didn't mind losing the use of my hand for 20 minutes from the mighty blow of her avenging ladle. Besides, now that I think of it, she had forks right there too and could have used one of those.  Anyway, the tacqueria lady's Jalapeno Taco Sauce is the real thing.  Hand made, fresh, chunky vibrant and just plain good.  The Taco Bell stuff is the polar opposite, physically, morally and spiritually. The Taco Lady told me to leave the bottle, and since she was wielding her ladle, I did.  She picked up the bottle with two fingers and disposed of it, presumably where children or small animals could not find it.<br /><br />And for the record, I like a lot of bottled dressings. I'm not a salad dressing snob, I don't require Extra Extra Virgin Olive Oil squeezed between the knees of unsullied maidens, nor do I hunt out balsamic vinegar aged for 1,000 years under the headpieces of Sicilian nuns.  Sure I prefer hand-crafted dressings, as long as somebody else's hands are doing the crafting, but when I'm doing the work, I find Oriental Chef Asian Sesame just fine for salads, and Buttermilk Ranch perfect for dipping celery or carrots (which don't deserve anything better).  And as far as Kraft Cole Slaw dressing is concerned, it's perfect. Mayonnaisy, sweet but not too sweet, just like Momma made, if momma had made cole slaw instead of picking it up from the deli like a normal person.<br /><br />So what would I suggest serving with Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce?  You might give it to your kids to put on a turkey burger if you are the kind of evil degenerate who pretends ground turkey is food and wants Junior to dump you into a nursing home when you grow your first gray hair. In the meantime, I think you should visit a certain taco stand on Sherman Way in Van Nuys. Tell the lady that you want a turker burger taco with miracle whip. Heh heh."

241594,B0081XPTBS,2.0,"I have to say that I really wanted this formula to work for our son. My husband and I are big whole foods, organic people, and wanted that for our son as well when my milk supply never grew to be sufficient for him. This was clearly imperfect (only breast milk is perfect), but it was organic, and I didn't want my baby consuming chemicals.<br /><br />Everything worked out fine for about 4 weeks. Our son would spit up to some extent after almost every feeding, but we attributed it to HIM having some issues, not the formula. As he started to better ""communicate"" with us, we realized that he would cry nonstop during his feedings, which didn't seem normal. He would continue to suck, but would sob through his eating. It was heartbreaking. We burped him incessantly, thinking it may be gas, but it wasn't. He wouldn't sleep because he was so fussy, and nothing would calm him. He had a dirty diaper only once a day (sometimes even less), and they would often be harder than we would have expected.<br /><br />After doing extensive research, we started our little one on Gerber Good Start Protect. It contains only whey protein and not casein, which is known to create curds in baby's tummy (in ANYONE'S tummy, really). It also has probiotics (like breast milk). When we gave him his first bottle of the new stuff, he saw the bottle and started to pout, and once he started drinking, you could almost SEE the relief on his face. He did not fuss at all through his feedings, and he was instantly happier and calmer. My smiling, beautiful boy was back! After almost 9 days of naps of an hour or less, he got back to his regular 2-3 hour naps and better sleeping at night.<br /><br />While I want my son to have the most wholesome ingredients possible, I believe sometimes the way those ingredients are mixed can be a negative, and I think that may be the case with this formula. We'll continue with our Gerber Good Start, and as much breast milk as possible."

I prefer almost any of the other gluten-free bars I've tried - Gluten-Free Cafe lemon sesame bars, Larabars (all of them - especially apple pie), Kind fruit and nut bars, etc.  But these aren't terrible - and unlike the other bars named, they don't tempt me to snack on them when I'm at home and other food is available, which means I have them available for road trips when I need them."

However...this is the worst tasting hummus I have ever had in my entire life. The chocolate was crushed and resembled taffy. The trail mix is good, as are the crackers, especially considering they're gluten free. I purchased this six pack for around $18. At the current price ($29), I don't think I would purchase these at around $5 a piece - just get together some gluten free snacks and put them together in your own lunch kit."
165651,B002EYETG6,3.0,"I LOVE the all-natural, high-protein profile of this bar - it has 16g protein in 160 calories. ...And the first bite tastes great...until you chew a little, and all you taste is that chalky, soy-protein powder flavor. I mean, they're healthy, convenient and edible, but if you like to chew and really enjoy your food, it's disappointing. (I tried two of the three flavors - same problem.)"
163612,B000E39P9U,3.0,"As I am attempting to ""green"" up my lifestyle, I originally bought these to use for used cat litter and dirty diapers, but ended up replacing my seventh gen kitchen trash bags (temporarily) with these neat biodegradable bags.  I love the idea of them breaking down, allowing my trash a chance to biodegrade faster.<br /><br />  These are a ""whisper of a trash bag"" and I had the most challenging task of using these during the prime summer months (Jun-Aug).  My trash is picked up once a week (like most people's), and I experimented with these by emptying my cat's litter box (we use feline pine) in a bio bag.  The litter had to sit 5 days before pick up, and I even kept the bag in a cool place.  Wrong.  The bag broke down and I had the unfortunate task of double bagging (that's where these bags would become outrageously unaffordable).  Next, I changed my cat box changing schedule so that I would empty it on trash day (this experiment was in July).  Still no good.  My trash collectors come in the mid afternoon and the bag didn't make it through the hot humid day.  From my experiments (at least in the summer months), I could not use these bags individually for feline pine cat litter.<br /><br />  Next, I used these bags for my diaper pail (still summer).  I only have one toddler (almost 2) in diapers, and I found that the bag is fine if it is used for diapers (no wipes in the pail) and taken out weekly (which gets only halfway full in 7 days), but if I waited until I filled my diaper pail (which takes about 2 weeks), too much moisture got built up in the pail and the bag dissolved. Most people don't want stinky diapers kicking it in the house for 2 weeks, but it's unfortunate to use these expensive bags to half capacity, so either way, you lose.<br /><br />  Finally, I found a use for these bags, and that was as my main kitchen bag; but, you have to make significant changes in the way you throw out trash.  First off, I read up on these bags, and a previous reviewer stated that if you put your wet trash in, say, an empty bread bag you were going to discard anyway, that these bags will work.  I had saved a bunch of these kinds of bags for my cat's litter, so that's how I made these bio bags work.  I'd line my can with the bio bag, and on top of the closed can, I'd have an old bagel bag or deli lunch meat ziplock as my wet trash reserve, and if I came up on wet trash I'd put it in that bag, then once that filled up I put the bag of wet trash in the bio bag.  As long as the trash didn't get too heavy (or wet), my biobags would make it through a week.  If you put wet trash (kitchen scraps, baby wipes, etc) in a biobag, you're doomed.<br /><br />  From my experience using the biobags, they really make you cognizant of how you throw things away.  Sure, it seems pointless to put your trash in a bunch of basically plastic bags to put it in another bag, but at least you are taking one layer of plastic out of the equation.  Every plastic bag I used to hold wet trash was going to be in my trash, anyway.  You'd be surprised how many odd plastic bags you throw away (bread bags, empty chip bags, empty cereal bags, etc).  It also showed me just how much wet, compostable garbage I make (kitchen scraps), and it proved to me how I really make enough fruit and veggie scraps for composting.  But on the other hand, biobags turned me into a total neurotic over my trash can, as I played trash police with my family and friends.  If you can get everyone around you to get with the ""system,"" these bags will work for you.  For me, honestly, it wasn't worth all the trouble.  I am still sticking with my seventh generation trash bags. :("

166913,B008B80MF6,3.0,"I saw this product on Shark Tank, and all the ""Sharks"" seemed to love it. I tried to order directly from the girls website, but shipping was just outrageous to New Jersey. Fortunately as an Amazon Prime member - I took advantage of the free shipping and ordered through Amazon. As usual, the package arrived quickly and all FIVE of us, went crazy to try the PB's! It was very runny, but we tried all of the flavors on a ritz cracker. The Kids and my wife all liked the Honey Pretzel best. I liked the cinnamon raisin, but it was a lukewarm ""like"" at best. None of the PB's had much flavor, kinda bland. I noticed it was very runny - so we stirred em up a bit and put them in the fridge to stiffen up. A day or so later, we tried them again - even more bland from the fridge. Maybe I didn't stir em up enough? I don't know - but now they're too hard to stir at all, so we'll see if we have the will to finish a jar or two if they get any more flavorful? Overall, we think it's way overpriced for the taste. We won't be buying any more jars, which is a shame cause I did want to support the fledgling company. I do wish them the best of luck though. To be fair we ONLY tried the 3 PB flavors. Nothing else.. So the othr flavors/products may be fantastic. Do try them, but a caution on the 3 flavors above, simply ""ok""."

152845,B005NYXE1U,3.0,"Thank God, I had the package delivered directly to my home before handing it over as a gift. The package is a wonderful idea; However, I was slightly disappointed in the presentation and the lack of items used. This gift is a bit of fun not a ton of fun nor a pound of candy! I was underwhelmed with how little of product received for the cost paid. The excitment of opening the package was taken down a notch or two by the tacky paper used and the poor presentation of the items within. The chocolate seemed old and a lot of the candies were unidentifiable due to perhaps it being from the East Coast rather the West. I strongly suggest having the gift box delivered to you before giving. This will enable you to locate and fill the box completely with more nostalgia goodies unlike what the company claims to be included. It was a blast reminising on the past! Now, my only hope is that this gift box brings the receiver the same joy I got after the box was completed with more candy and festive decorations purchased from Target and the Dollar Store around town. Overall, this is a fun gift that lacks charm due to it's presentation and lack of candy! Eat responsibly!"

I myself need more than just one packet and will typically use a plain and another flavor to use up the plain oatmeal.

Several people complain of the price but not having to deal with going to the store for it and the taxes of it more than makes up for any differences.
80089,B0000D9589,4.0,"If you like the classic taste of a good margarita, it's likely you'll find Baja Bob's Margarita Mix to be an acquired taste at best and a cruel joke at worst.  Not that it tastes horrible, but like most contests between similar products that are sugar-based and sugar-free, the recipe for which you already have a preference is going to win despite the competition's particular and sometimes overwhelming merits.  Since I've decided to limit my sugar intake but not my affection for margaritas, this tequila mixer is best suited to take care of the problem, so I've decided to stick with it and learn to like it.  Over time I've at least grown accustomed to the taste (adding extra Triple Sec helps), even if I can't say it's the best improvement to margaritas since the salt rimmed glass.  Splenda certainly works better in some things than others.  In this case it's a qualified success with taste taking a subjective second place to functionality.  I don't love it or hate it, but I don't miss the sugar either.  To that end Baja Bob's Margarita Mix does what it's supposed to do very well."

Making the coffee is very easy - just put a few teaspoons (they recommend four) into a mug with hot water.<br /><br />I really loved the smell of this coffee. The pumpkin scent is great, and really makes you think of Fall. My problem was that it was really too rich to drink more than a couple sips. The coffee seemed very sweet, and didn't match the smell, meaning that the actual coffee didn't have that ""bite"" of pumpkin. I didn't find it very satisfying. However, a couple family members said it ""wasn't too bad"" and did manage to drink the whole thing. So I think a lot depends on your taste. Overall, it is a rich coffee that is best used for an occasional treat rather than as your regular morning beverage."

These are a workout for your jaw.  2) The fruit flavors are indistinguishable from each other.  I can't stand that all the different colored bears taste the same.  I was expecting much better flavors from yummy earth based on the hard candy flavors which are very good. 3) Flavor is unbalanced.  These bears have a very one-note sweet taste.

Lunch alone is not enough, he has to eat between classes.  Yes, I know, if I could get some more protein into his snacks that would stick with him longer, but I also have to send what he will eat, and he eats these, whereas the other bars came back home.

I was excited the day it came (like 10 days after my order) and got out some of my homemade, wood-fired oven baked ciabatta bread. A big sloppy dip (I like olive oil) on a hunk of bread entered my mouth and... what happened to the smoke? There wasn't a whole lot of smoke to begin with, but the initial flavor literally fell off.

(I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.

I've tried really hard to make it taste good to me but It's horrible in my opinion. I really really wanted it to be good... mocha and protein, it would have been so nice."

It makes a strong cup of coffee. I drink this round the clock, whenever I want a cup of coffee. I guess you can say, I am kind of a round-the-clock coffee drinker. Newman's Own Bold is very good."
16656,B001LGGH40,5.0,"The Kiwi Berry flavor has a tarty but sweet taste. Neither the strawberry nor kiwi is overpowering. Instead, I was treated to the best of both flavors! There was very little carbonation. My favorite Switch flavor!"
235889,B001D0IZ80,2.0,"This is really awful coffee.  For some reason, Amazon stopped carrying the Gloria Jeans hazelnut decaf, which actually tastes like hazelnut, and coffee.  This coffee is weak, even on the strongest brew selection, and the vanilla and hazelnut taste very similar.  I don't know if Timothy's is at fault, or whether Amazon shipped five year old stale cups, but I can't in good faith recommend this product."

""Breakfast blend"" is her favorite coffee choice, one of the coffee selections her employer supplies for their Keurig brewers.  She does not judge the taste of the Timothy's brand as good as the Green Mountain brand provided by her employer.  Having tried both, I concur.  The taste is not bad - just not as good.  However, the price per k-cup for the Timothy's brand is attractive.  For us, this is a case of one gets what one pays for."
79470,B003TNANSO,4.0,"These nutrition-packed bars are delicious and I highly recommend them for an energy boost.  One slight drawback is that in the heat/summer, they tend to become quite soft and mushy and can be a mess to open and eat, especially if you are carrying one with you."
16778,B001LGGH40,5.0,"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me of nothing that I had every tasted before. I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's."
81795,B005CUU25G,4.0,"The lickety stick is not a lollipop.  It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better."

I thought it was a mistake with my first daughter but when we stopped by my second daughters apartment on the way home I noticed that hers was broken up too.  She said that it was also very hard and dry.  I would definitely purchase again IF they fixed their packaging."
77011,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"This will be a short review, because there's not much to say.  All there is to say, is this: Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is pretty tasty and made a good munching treat.<br /><br />The chocolate bits in it aren't high quality confection, but they're better than, say, the waxy chocolate bits you might normally get in a grocery-aisle chocolate chip granola bar. The wheat and such comes in small, flaky bits (I might have preferred slightly larger nuggets), and it's very dusty, so keep a dry towel on hand.  I also appreciated that it came in a resealable bag, so I could just keep in in a drawer at my work desk without needing a separate container."

I make sure my water is absolutely cold before I mix in the crystal light and it is SOOOOO refreshing. My favorite is the wild strawberry. It reminds me of the strawberries my mom used to grow.

240218,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"I received this product to review via the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />My Siberian Husky likes this food, but he's not overeager to eat it. However, I won't be buying it for him, even if he thought it were the best thing on the planet. Corn as its first and main ingredient tells me a lot about the nutrition. Sure, dogs are omnivores, but they're not meant to eat diets THAT high in grains!<br /><br />I also find the ""Beneful"" name and its description of the product to be misleading. The name of the product suggests that it's healthier than other dog foods, but anyone feeding this to their dog would have about the same health benefits (or lack thereof) as any other non-premium dog food<br /><br />It passed my dog's taste test in that he eats it, and it doesn't make him sick, hence the rating of more than one star. My response is after reading the ingredient list was to start mixing it with his regular, premium dog foods, which are healthier... like his grain free products. That eliminates the other stars.<br /><br />The health of my pets is paramount. My last dog, an 85 lbs pound pup (we THINK a Shiloh shepherd or a Malamute / Belgian Tervuren mix), lived to 18 years on the premium dog foods I fed him and his home-made jerky treats where I use extra lean ground meat (usually turkey), jerky seasonings, and Dog Bloom VM Supreme dog vitamins (powdered, with real cheddar cheese powder to give it added flavor)."

80283,B004342XH2,4.0,"With winter approaching I bought this as a trial.  I was concerned that it would taste watered down because I feel that many of the Keuring coffees taste that way; I like the extra bold varieties or Starbucks Italian Roast on my own K cup.<br /><br />I was actually rather pleasantly surprised as to how much like real hot cocoa it tasted.  Not watered down and not too sweet.  It's not gourmet but this winter, when you want a quick cup of hot cocoa after shoveling snow or playing outside, this will do nicely."
237642,B001CHFSR0,2.0,"From the name, I was expecting a mocha flavor.  I ordered the two boxes of this as well as the variety pack.  Every flavor in the variety pack is better than the Mudslide.

149566,B000E8WIAS,3.0,"Maybe my expectations were too high. Heeding the warnings about adding too much I started with 8 oz of bottled seltzer and added a few drops. The taste was more of a hint than a true flavoring so I added a little more, figuring if I got the taste I liked I'd start from scratch and get a better measurement. It never happened for me. When I added enough to create some flavor I also found an aftertaste that was somewhat alcohol-y. Not a problem for most people but I strongly dislike the taste of alcohol so it's not good for me. Played with it some more and never got a satisfactory result. Into the fridge, back of the shelf.<br /><br />A couple of weeks later I came home with some diet orange soda. Thought I'd try it again and see if I could make some orange cream soda and voila! Delicious. I say this having only tried one 8 oz serving and I made it a little too sweet but I have no doubt that once I get the ratio correct I'll add this to any orange soda I drink from now on. I'll probably try it with other flavors too altho orange seems to be the sure thing."

77114,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"As the name says, this Back to Nature whole grain snack is delightful -  Tasty, crunchy, with just enough dark chocolate to add a moderate sweetness.  It's difficult to stop once you start munching!<br /><br />The one problem with Chocolate Delight Granola is the consistency.  After a few nice, crunchy clusters at the top of the bag, the rest amounted to tiny clusters or loose grain with a cereal like consistency.  It makes for a messy snack and almost makes you want to run for a cereal bowl, milk and spoon.<br /><br />Still the taste is very good and the crunch remains even when the remaining clusters are tiny.  Plus the added benefit of whole grain makes this a worthwhile snack."

After it's cooked, you don't know to slice or scoop out the bird. There was very little turkey meat on the outside and the inside had more rice than duck or sausage. Plus, it was dry. There were no juices when I cooked it. Luckily, we also cooked a traditional turkey which fed everyone. After all said and done, after $110, the Turducken was stuffing.  I will never buy again."

77390,B0054S6L6A,4.0,These are the best organic chocolate chips I can find without soy. Strange because Sunspire puts soy in their semi-sweet chips but not their bittersweet chips. DO NOT buy from Vitacost. They offer free shipping after $49 but their inventory is very old and close to expiration dates on every single thing I have ever ordered from them. Which pretty much defeats the point of stocking up. I cancelled my account with Vitacost and was not pleased to see them showing up on Amazon as the only vendor for many of my favorite items. I think Bangella is better but more expensive. Best to buy in local stores if you can. That way you are assured of the expiration dates.

This tea is a dingy looking, ""pea green"" and fairly bitter... whereas other higher quality more expensive brands are brighter and fresher tasting (the brighter the tea the BETTER quality it is).<br /><br />Although green tea is ingredibly healthy, you HAVE to be very careful about your source since manyof the poorer quality green teas (particularly those grown in China, Pakistan, and India) contain potentially high levels of metals such as fluoride, lead, and aluminum.

249667,B001LGGH54,2.0,"I don't normally like fruit flavored carbonated drinks and Switch Watermelon Strawberry was no different.  The fruit flavor tasted authentic enought but the carbonation ruined it.  Dispite the claim that it contains natural ingredients, it's sweetness was enhanced with additives.  It was too sweet and not the least bit refreshing which is what I look for in a drink."
249441,B001LGGH54,2.0,"This product label says that it is ""the perfect balance between juice and carbonation"", but I think the maunfacturer still needs to reduce the carbonation further. Also, I tried a couple of other flavors beside this one, and they are all mostly apple, grape, and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called ""Watermelon Strawberry"", and both of these fruits actually are listed on the ingredients label, unlike some of their other drinks. It is true that no corn syrup has been added, but there are still high sugars and carbs. This little 8.3 ounce can has 140 pretty empty calories in it. I think children will like these really sweet flavors, so it could be a good alternative to soda for parents to offer their little ones."
17409,B004P8JNFQ,5.0,"We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a ""catkins"" diet.  Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved.  The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong ""Call of the Wild"" into the meat.<br /><br />Turkey is their 2nd favorite fowl, more than chicken, but less than quail.

I bought the brownies and the devils food cake mixes first and LOVED LOVED LOVED both of them. I eat gluten but my 3 year old does not and I couldn't even tell that they were gluten free. Being as excited as I was about the brownies and chocolate cake I decided to give the yellow cake a try as well. I really wished I liked it but I didn't. The cake looked great but had a funny taste to it and a strange smell. First I thought I did something wrong so I went over my steps but I did what the box said and even used real butter and a good vanilla extract. I really think that this can be great because the texture is amazing. Hoping Betty Crocker changes the recipe because this has potential.

I had to tear bits of fat from each strip before I ate and I could still feel my mouth coated with grease as I chewed.<br /><br />And again, this may have been related to my particular batch, but calling these ""spicy"" is laughable as I wasn't able to get a even a hint of a kick from any of the three bags I ordered.  If I'd known that these were about as spicy as ketchup, I would not have ordered tham and will likely not order them again because I prefer my jerky to have at least a little heat.<br /><br />Those complaints aside, this stuff is very tender and has a good and strong BBQ flavor (spicy or no).  I've never eaten Stubb's BBQ, but if this is a reasonable approximation of what goes on in his restaurants, then I wouldn't hesitate in stopping and eating there.  I'd just bring my own Tabasco."

My local grocery store carries so many Joyva products, but for some reason they don't carry the Joyva Jelly Rings. They carry these instead. They are so awful! I thought it may have been a flock when I bought the first box of these, so I gave them a second chance. BIG MISTAKE. The second box was just as nasty as the first. I asked the grocery manager why they carried these and he told me that the Kosher section wasn't handled by the regular grocery distributor, and that this is all they could get.<br /><br />I know by the Joyva rings online and just have to deal with their hipping costs. SO WORTH IT!"
128927,B000KSQ146,1.0,I am very disappointed in this product.  I regularly order Peruvian organic from Gevalia.  I was looking for something cheaper.  This definitely tastes cheaper!

I'd recommend without hesitation as it was also a good value."
247946,B004T3QMD8,2.0,"The strongest taste out if this product is the non-dairy creamer and it's heavy on that. It doesn't even taste like coffee or pumpkin spice...very weak. Since I don't particularly care for the taste of powdered non-dairy creamer, I can't give it more than 2 stars."
132732,B001SAQG18,1.0,"Horrible aftertaste! Perhaps I added too much (4 packs) but it was absolutely not edible. I couldn't even drink my morning coffee when I added this. I switched to Truvia and it was MUCH better. Generally, the Stevia plant is quite bitter, but by using the sweetest part of the plant as Truvia has done, the horrid after taste can be extinquished with nothing but sweetness left. I am not entirely sure what part of the plant PurVia uses, but I thought it the most reasonable explanation for the differences between the tastes (Truvia vs. PurVia)."

I bought about 10 jars intending to give it to family and friends (especially those who are mindful of their caloric and nutritional intake) as part of their Christmas gifts and am RELIEVED to find it tastes good!  It will be well received by my family and friends.  I have only tried it as a spread and look forward to using it in smoothies.

The good news is this drink won't escalate the national deficit.<br /><br />I tried the black cherry variety. To be honest, I thought the 8.3 ounces was a bit sparse. I'm used to a full 12 ounces. I liked the cherry flavor. The carbonation was not over powering, just enough for a slight fizz.<br /><br />The product bills itself as all natural. No sweeteners were added, a good thing as my son gets enough in the line of sugars. But my son doesn't drink sodas and didn't want to try this. (More for dad, eh?) It claims to be 100% juice. Now the labeling can say one thing, but what does the required ""Nutrition Facts"" say? It does claim 33g of sugar (in an 8.3 ounce can). Since the bottle of Cherry Coke Zero doesn't even list sugar, I'm not sure how to take that information. Or is the sugar fructose from the cherry juice itself?<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the drink. I haven't seen it on the store shelves yet--but it is available at Amazon. Try it for a refreshing change."

With<br />high hopes I placed it in my trusty Keurig and pressed the button.  This was without a doubt the most vile bitter tasting coffee I have ever had including the stuff they sell by the<br />gallons in gas stations.  At first I could not believe it and brewed another cup as well as a cup of two other brands of k-cups, Starbucks and Green Mountain comparable dark roasts.  I<br />tasted them all black and what a difference.  Even though these are cheaper save your money, do not buy this product."

This stuff is terrible if you want a sweet tasting product.  No amount of sweetner can help and now I'm out the money for a product that I can't return....that isn't right.  If bought at a store they would take the unopened items back. Guess I'll have to donate it. If you want good tasting sugar free french vanilla cappuccino then order Victorian Inn.  At least theirs isn't bitter like this stuff by Caffe D'Vita.  Regular Caffe D'Vita is good, sugar free is bad very very bad."
17141,B00073MFRQ,5.0,I cannot locate this product anywhere locally.  Tried the local coffee houses.  The product they use for cappaccino has a lot of sugar in it.<br /><br />The product I purchased from Amazon which I have been using for a number of years has minimal sugar in it and a strong vanilla flavor which I like.  So glad you can provide it for me.<br /><br />Thank you.

148681,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"After receiving my box of Big Nuts bars from Amazon Vine, I eagerly tore into the box to get my first taste of this treat.  Expecting something more along the lines of a candy bar, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste: peanuty, definitely, with a slight sense of the granola bar that it is meant to imitate. They are not overpoweringly sweet, but the second and third ingredients in the label are sugar and corn syrup. At 220 calories a pop, they could easily be diet killers, including the 22 g of carbs each medium sized bar provides. Would I purchase these in the store? Probably not. Granola bars aren't my favorite thing. It was worth a taste, however."
151081,B001Q9EFW8,3.0,"I love the idea of this dog treat, that it cleans teeth and freshens breath.  However, to get the maximum effect of that, the box suggests feeding him two bones a day every day for the cleanest teeth.  I normally don't treat my dog that often, because I don't think it's that good for him and also the cost of treats.  I'd have to buy a box a week to keep up with that!  But as to the taste of it, my dog was very unappealed by it.  He still ate them, as he is a dog afterall, but he would put it down and come back to it and work on it almost in the way he does actual dry bones.  I just think it lacks the taste and therefore his interest.  He much prefers tastier treats as he gobbles them up or spends his time gnawing on his bones. But I still give 3 stars as it does seem to help his teeth and breath!  Now if they could just make it more appetizing.  My guy is not, by far, a picky eater, so if he's pickin' there's a problem!"

75861,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"The vast majority of my rating for this one comes down to taste. It's a carbonated drink that tastes a bit like a fruity soda, but the sweetness is a little smoother and nicer than soda typically is.<br /><br />The big drawback here is that a 16-ounce can contains 260 calories of sugar. After some thought about how I wanted to consume this once I realized how much sugar was involved, I saved it for a day when I knew I'd be walking for several hours so that I could just drink it when I knew my body had plenty of use for the sugar. I wouldn't recommend it as a drink to have sitting down at a desk or something like that, because that's a lot of sugar to be consuming if you're not doing anything at that moment to burn through it. The company does make a sugar free version <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO3AUW"">No Fear, Sugar Free, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, though I haven't tasted that, so that's an option to try for those times when you want an energy drink but you won't be moving around much."

239168,B001874C12,2.0,"I can tell you from experience that it is not hard to make healthy, low calorie, low sodium soup that tastes good.<br /><br />Calories for this soup are OK, and it has a few carrot pieces in it for a little extra nutrition. However, the taste was totally bland. It is commendable that they used less salt. However, they could have added a little rosemary and/or garlic, for example, and produced an enjoyable taste without one bit of extra calories or sodium. I also found the chicken to be overcooked and rubbery, as were the pasta curls that they think are ""noodles"".<br /><br />Yesterday I had a can of Progresso Classics Vegatable that was the same calories, more nutricious, and full of flavor. Even the old fashioned small can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle is a better bowl of soup than this. No more ""Healthy Choice"" in our pantry."

It contains alcohol, sugars, fungi, yeast and molds, and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida. I've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps, now that I know more.

I tried to chew 4 pieces (2 supposedly gives you the same amount of caffeine as in an energy drink) and that didn't give me near the amount of energy that a monster does. You do feel a little tingle after chewing 4  pieces but it's more like the feeling you get when you eat a candy bar or drink hot chocolate. I'm guessing that the claims for containing the amount of caffeine is true, but my body isn't absorbing it optimally (If I caffeine pill it - generic caffeine pills from walmart - then I get close to the energy drink energy burst)"

It was absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Though not bad, they are not delicious or satisfying on their own, but if you find a good combination of toppings, you can end up with a delicious treat that's perfect for snacking. The result really depends on what you put on them, as texture is the most prevalent contribution the Wasa crispbreads provide; their flavor is very subtle, and the crackers are very light, and crisp."

I like them even when I'm not in the mood for something cookie'ish, I like them with tea, I like them with coffee, I like them with pepper jack cheese (everything goes with pepper jack). Also because they usually aren't terribly sweet and when I go to the trouble of baking them, they seem to last longer than other cookies (I mean they still taste good the next day, not that I can resist eating them all straight from the baking sheet).<br /><br />But these ginger snaps are not right.<br /><br />They are chewy and gritty.  Stale but burnt in places.  I know, it sounds like a manufacturing problem and I thought perhaps the unburnt, not stale ones would be okay if they were rebaked.  Nope.  I picked through the bag to find the snaps that weren't burnt, I put them in the oven to 're-crisp' at a low temp (250F) for about five minutes, in the end they still tasted bitter, gitty, stale and overly sweet.<br /><br />The price is right at around $3 a bag, but I think you'd be better off buying an old tried and true brand, such as Nabisco Ginger Snaps (sweetish, super crispy, reliably cooked for an even crisp texture) or Anna's Ginger Thins, my new favorite store brand of Ginger Snaps (they are wafer thin, spicy and go well with ice cream)."

The sauce has a creamy salad dressing thickness to it and overall this is a very neutral flavor. It's not bad, but it's not good enough to recommend. It definitely needed more jalapeno snap to it."
123881,B005JTMZVO,1.0,This popcorn is the worst popcorn i've ever had.  It smells horrible!!  It also made me a bit queezy afterwards.  I would not reccomend this

148631,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"FLAVOR<br />As everyone else agrees, this is pretty tasty. It is full of delicious nutty flavor. But, it barely has a hint of granola (in my opinion). Also, it is very filling. I only ate half of the first bar I tried because I was full thanks to all the nuts. Nuts, in moderation, are a good source of good fats.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL INFO<br />The bar is indeed big; about 30% bigger than regular granola bars. This 46 gram bar has 220 calories, no trans fats, 3 grams of saturated fats, 160 mg of sodium, 22 g of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, 12 grams of sugar, 7 grams of protein, a negligible amounts of calcium and iron, 100% of you Vitamin E daily value and 10% of your daily value of Phosphorous. It has no other vitamins. It also has 3.5 grams of  polyunsaturated fats and 6 grams of monosaturated fats.<br /><br />All these fats are not unhealthy. As I mentioned before, nuts are a good source of healthy fats. But, this bar may just a be too big for a regular snack.<br /><br />COMPARISON WITH A SIMILAR BAR<br />A single Planters bar is 220 calories, almost as much as a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7RDOC"">Clif Bar</a> (240 calories), but not as healthy. Why? The Planters bar has 110 calories from fat which equals to 13 grams of fat, 20% of your daily value. It also has 3 grams of saturated fats, which is not the best heart healthy choice. Whereas a Clif Bar has 7 grams of fat, 11 % of your daily value and 1.5 grams of saturated fats.<br /><br />Also, Clif bars are made with organic ingredients. Two of the first three ingredients of a Planters bar are: sugar and corn syrup. Doctors, nutritionists, exercise and health experts all tell you to avoid or reduce food items that have sugar and corn syrup in the first five listed ingredients.<br /><br />It also has artificial flavors AND more sugar (brown sugar, dextrin, fructose, evaporated cane juice, etc.). Yes, I know that Clif bars have 21 grams of sugar, but at least they are natural and organic based. Moreover, the Clif bar is full of vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />Further, the Clif bar is recommended for people doing high intensity sports or requiring sustained energy: hiking, rock climbing, or any other sports.  This Planters bar being advertised as a snack.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />Is such a big bar truly necessary, especially for a snack? This bar makes me think of the McDonald's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVBO"">Super Size</a> idea. But, bigger is not necessarily better. A snack should not be so substantial high in calorie and fat content, unless you are about to go on a 8 mile hike or you are replacing an entire meal with this bar. As a snack, it is too much. I do not recommend as a regular snack.<br /><br />Full nutritional info below:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts - 1 bar - 220 calories, 12 grams of fat, 1.5 grams of saturated fat, 0 grams of trans fat, 3.5 grams of polyunsaturated fat, 6 grams of monounsaturated fat, 0 milligrams of cholesterol, 230 milligrams of sodium, 23 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, 13 grams of sugar, 7 grams of protein, 2% calcium, 100% vitamin E and 10% phosphorus.)<br /><br />Ingredients: Peanuts, Corn Syrup, Sugar, Peanut Butter (Roasted Ground Peanuts), Crisped Rice (Rice Flour, Sugar, Malt Extract, Salt, Caramel Color, Mixed Tocopherols (to Help Protect Flavor)), Evaporated Cane Juice Invert Syrup, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Fractionated Palm Kernel,  Oil, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Brown Sugar, Whole Grain Rolled Wheat, Coconut, Canola Oil, Wheat Bran), Partially Defatted Peanut Flour, Salt, fructose, Contains less than 1.5% of Sodium Caseinate (From Milk) Soy Lecithin, Resistant Corn Dextrin, Natural Flavor, Mixed Tocopherols (to help protect flavor)."
125144,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"I just tried a sample of it in a bag of Lindt truffles.  The sample was about the 1 inch by 1 inch, and although I LOVE chocolate (especially dark!) I wouldn't have wanted to eat any more of that stuff.  It is, indeed, awful.  Completely bland and very waxy: the taste and texture are BOTH horrible.  I find it impossible to believe that a whole company that produces chocolate for a living could imagine that this is a good product, so all I can assume is that they, too, must know that it really sucks.  How can they sleep at night knowing that they are producing such horribly pathetic chocolate?  Thank goodness I didn't pay anything for this woefully sub-par sample!!"
16735,B001LGGH40,5.0,"This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice concentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.<br /><br />As to taste: This was close to what I was expecting, but surprisingly sweet.  I could taste the kiwi and berry.  The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.<br /><br />I tasted this flavor as well as the ""black cherry"" flavor.  I didn't like black cherry, but I liked this and would have it again.  If the concept of carbonated fruit juice appeals to you, then<br />this is a good flavor to start with.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional information:  8.5fl oz., 135 calories, 0g fat, 15 mg sodium, 34 g total carbs, 33 g sugar, 0g protein, 100% vitamin C.<br /><br />ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (vitamin C)"

Try it with a little rice vinegar added and it is a great dipping sauce for egg rolls, california rolls and gyozas.

All you have to do is take the top off and squeeze the sides of container. It is easy to use.

130974,B0002L3BYO,1.0,I was so excited to get this after reading some really good reviews.  It tasted sorta chocolately at first and then the after taste hits.  It was horrible and I could still taste it a half hour later.  Very disappointing!
151197,B001EO608C,3.0,"You have to be careful of how long, and at what temperature you prepare this tea. I would recommend 180F and not a second over 5 minutes. This tea has a tendency to become extremely bitter very quickly. Another note, most of the fruit pieces will settle to the bottom of the bag, so make sure you get a good mix of leaves and fruit before you steep. If done properly it can taste very good, but again the margin of error on this one is slim."
247478,B000FFLTM8,2.0,"Just to let everyone know, this product is NOT gluten free. It contains barley, which is not a GF grain. My favorite Dr. McDougall's soup is the Black Bean! So good!"
77801,B001LG940E,4.0,"The Switch says that their sodas have no added sugar - but it's a bit of a dodge because they add a ton of concentrated fruit juices (apple, grape, and acerola join cherry fruit juices).  All that sugar totals a whopping 33 grams in an 8.3 oz can - far more than, say, Cocoa Cola for the same volume (27g).  The black cherry flavor, however, is tart and real and true and its yumminess transcends all that (natural) sugar.  The color is real too - a lovely brick red with a hint of fruity opaqueness.  The carbonation is light and feels right.  All in all, The Switch Black Cherry is a real treat.  It tastes just like the cherries in the cherry pie I get at the diner.  Sweet and rich, with a lovely dose of tartness; there's no false note in this big rich flavor at all.  The only downside is the cloying sweetness that creeps in the aftertaste.  35 grams of sugar is just too much.  If they had toned it down a bit this would be a much better product, in my opinion."
150833,B00469Q9HY,3.0,"Great price on this special. After having some of this coffee at a high end restarant in Sedona AZ I thought I would order some, It had a fair amount of bittetness which was not present in the  restaurant version  The brewer machine I use does better on starbuck's.  It is good but not as good as I expected or hoped for.  Still a great purchase price"
151173,B001Q9EFW8,3.0,"I have 2 medium sized dogs, a siberian husky who is a bit of a picky eater and my puli who is a trash can. They both are typically fed Wellness brand products, so I wasn't sure how they would like  the Crunch 'n Clean biscuits.<br />My puli, being the little trash can he is, stared at and played with a biscuit for a while before digging in, which is not his usual form. However, after a few minutes he snarfed it right up and he has continued to do so for the past several days.<br />My husky on the other hand initially left her biscuit and stared at it. Then she licked it and stared at me, leaving it on the ground and walking away.  I tried again the next day with similar results. On day three she begrudgingly took it and ate it, but she left bits of it all over the floor, which is not her MO for our normal brand.<br />I think, therefore, it is likely that how well your dog will or won't like these treats is dependent on how finicky your dog is.<br /><br />They do appear to assist with removal of food particles. I could not ascertain whether they assisted with tartar build-up removal as neither of my dogs really have this problem. However, if the loose food is removed, I suppose you could argue that it would reduce the potential for tartar build-up in the future. It did not make their breath smell remarkably different.<br /><br />The caloric content is high considering the ingredient list (50 cal/biscuit). This could be a problem for anyone with pets that have weight issues as the recommended serving is 2 biscuits twice a day for 200 calories total. The ingredient list also sports a number of grain products, wheat, barley flower,  and corn starch, which could be a problem if your pet has allergies. It also contains partially hydrogenated oils and sugars, neither of which are particularly good for either pets or people. So those people who worry about what their dogs eating, or those with pets with allergies will probably not find this product to their liking. I am most concerned with the calorie content and wonder if the reason I did not notice noticeably fresher breath was because I fed my dogs half the recommended serving (so 1 biscuit twice daily) as I have one pet whose weight I have to watch.<br /><br />All in all I think this is a split decision. I think many dogs will like the biscuits, like my puli and be just fine with them. They are a good size for the medium breeds and they probably will prevent future tartar build-up. For finicky eaters and/or owners, or those pets who have grain allergies, a different choice may make more sense."

Unfortunately my cats do not like this food - only one will eat the canned food and this same cat will not eat the dry, and oddly enough, vice versa.  The other cat will eat the dry but not the canned.  I have also noticed that their coats are not as silky as they were with another brand, which I will be going back to.

16657,B001LGGH40,5.0,"Recently I had the pleasure of trying the Kiwi Berry flavor of Switch 100% fruit juice. It is unbelievable that a sugarless carbonated drink can taste so great and yet be good for you. The Kiwi Berry was bold and tangy instead of sweet and cloying. The carbonation made the drink sparkling and energetic. Since I have recently kicked my 15 year habit of drinking Diet Coke, I have been looking for a substitute drink that wasn't straight fruit juice or straight soda. As an American I have become accustomed to thinking that carbonated drinks are the fun ones and that merely being healthy by drinking juice is boring. So Switch allows me to feel healthy and have some fun at  the same time while also giving up caffeine which I really don't want during the day. If Switch comes out with additional flavors I will certainly try those as well."

She forgot???!?  Well, bless her heart, that's what made them so GOOD; NO SAGE!!!  I tried several cookies just to see if this was a bad batch but the sage came through over and over.  It doesn't hit you immediately but, when it does, that's all you remember.

250929,B004DOXI9O,2.0,"I was really disappointed by these cookies.  Yes, they are gluten and egg free but they're also somewhat tasteless other than sweet.  The chocolate was completely melted and they were delivered on a day when the temps were in the 70s.  I let them get to room temp but the chocolate never solidified again.  The texture was what I would expect; soft and a little grainy but not bad.  I would have liked more ginger in the taste and less sweet.  I was not able to find a nutrition label other than the ingredients.  If you cannot have gluten, eggs, etc., you might like these cookies as a treat once in a while but you'll want to get them from a local store so you might have a chance to eat them before they melt.

249632,B001LGGH54,2.0,"Once again, in an effort to appease my hippy lady friend I tried some ""all-natural"" crap since my Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper didn't have enough natural ingredients.  She convinced me to buy a 24-pack of Switch Watermelon Strawberry soda, which cost me more than 5x as much money as my non-eco and non-zen-friendly Code Red.  I've purchased 24-packs of Budweiser that were cheaper and they came in 12-oz cans and not this dinky 9oz.<br /><br />And then there's the size issue.  Now, I'm told size doesn't matter (although, I'm convinced she lied) but I do feel like I'm coming up short when I'm faced with a 9oz as opposed to a regular 12oz.  This is especially true given the price.  It also fails to recognize my manhood, such as it is, when I'm grasping a can smaller than a Red Bull and it doesn't even give me wings.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed, when I opened the can, was the pleasant aroma remiscent of... Old Orchard?  I cracked open the first one while driving in my truck and my good buddy Drewfus sitting next to me took a sniff, looked over and asked, ""is that a soda or are you drinking apple juice?""  The scent was that pungent.<br /><br />As if to add insult to injury, I took my first swig.  The first thing I noticed was the high sugar content almost akin to a Monster drink.  To confirm this, I later examined the can (before properly disposing it at the shooting range) to discover Switch had more sugar than a regular coke and nearly as much as Dr. Pepper.  This is insane as it has more sugar content than an already sugar-filled drink that has three more ounces on it.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed in the taste was a very familiar element.  Almost as if I had tasted this before during my sober days.  Later, I found myself drinking a generic Shasta kiwi-strawberry soda I obtained from the local grocery store (Western Family equivilent for West Coast and Sam's for you Wal-Mart shoppers) and then it hit me, it tasted just like Switch.  I quickly grabbed another Switch can and compared; the tastes were nearly identical.<br /><br />So, what can I possibly get out of spending as much money for a 24-pack as I would for a Blu-Ray DVD that tastes like a generic?  Maybe feel greener since I drank something that I think came from environmentally friendly alluminum similar to environmentally friendly acid from hybrid car batteries.  It still tasted nice, but I felt seriously ripped off given the price.  I certainly was motivated to get more Busch Light since I seem to get more bang for my buck that way, which says A LOT."
79411,B003TNANSO,4.0,I ordered the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew bars and I was pleasantly surprised how good they tasted. My husband likes them and so does my daughter. The only thing is I wished they had a little less sugar. The nutritional facts say they have 14g of sugar. Now 14 grams of sugar is not bad if you are comparing it to a candy bar but for a nutritional bar I would ideally like 10g of sugar or less.

It only takes a 2-3 drops to sweeten my morning coffee, and give it a faintly chocolate flavor and smell.  It's not as chocolately as I'd like, but adding more drops makes it too sweet.<br /><br />I don't notice any aftertaste or bitterness after using stevia, although I've read reviews that other people do. The bottle lists the ingredients as ""Proprietary Blend, Purified Water, Stevia (Leaf) Extract, and Other Ingredients"" which makes me wonder what they've put in there that they can't tell me about.

238426,B0049J2ADS,2.0,"I know that many people loathe the taste of ginger and thus hate ginger ale (a soda that doesn't really reflect the actual peppery-nature of ginger root) but I've always loved both, despite the fact that their relation seems to be in name only.  Maybe the reason I love ginger (as a spice) is because it adds some ethnicity to a dish, instantly taking it away from `bland' and into `flavor'.  Maybe the reasons I love ginger ale is because it doesn't taste like ginger.  That is the biggest misstep with oogave's Agave Ginger Ale.  The aroma alone is almost off-putting, the rich ginger smell emanating from the open bottle.  The taste though, that is the kicker.  The ginger flavor is so thick, and the spicy tingle at the back of your throat; it's just not refreshing.  When I drink a soda, I want it to be a cleansing and refreshing feeling.  oogave's Agave Ginger Ale is far too savory for its own good.  A direct ginger flavor is the makings of Chai Tea, not soda pop.  Still, I love this company and their other products (far more appealing flavor profiles).  Sadly, this ginger ale lover was turned off by the one product he was most looking forward to trying.<br /><br />:-("

235985,B000COEZXC,2.0,"I ordered a six pack of Greenies Pill Pockets from EntirelyPets in 2010, from this page in Amazon (I know it was this page because it pops up one of those ""you already bought this"" notices), and received the Greenies brand.  Since then, however, the photo has been changed to a generic brand pill pocket (I can't enlarge it enough to see what brand, but it isn't Greenies), and EntirelyPets is no longer on the vendor list.  The Greenies photos are from a customer uploading photos, probably from back when the official photo was also Greenie brand.  The reviews, I am almost certain, are from when this page sold the Greenies brand name.  The description no longer calls these ""Greenies""-- it doesn't say what brand they are at all.  These generics may be just as good, I don't know.  But I do know that as of April, 2011, there are less expensive 6 packs, which are definitely Greenies brand, on other Amazon pages.  Just wanted to give a heads up in case people didn't know what the Greenies package looked like."

I did not find this brand of this variety of coffee to be as flavorful as beans from my usual supplier. It roasts well. In the roasting process it swells more than my favorite brand but that is not a problem - just an observation. I thought free shipping might save me money over what I had been paying but the disappointing lack of flavor has convinced me to go back to my usual supplier. Unfortunately, they do not sell through Amazon.com"

I also get cramps because its doing something to my digestive system.
17108,B0018CE5L4,5.0,"I have 4 cats and was spending an amazing amount of money shopping for them at Petsmarts and Petcos locally. I wish I would have discovered this food earlier. This 40lb bag lasts us nearly 2 months! If you order it new from Amazon you don't even have to worry about the shipping, it's free (and for something that weighs 40lbs that's a good thing!)<br /><br />The ingredients aren't that great but at least it's not Corn or grains as the first ingredient..so it's passable. I mix the dry food with higher quality canned food to give them that extra boost of protein and flavor since my cats tend to get bored of the same food over and over. I find if I mix it with different flavors of canned food they NEVER get tired of it (it can even be a small can, nothing fancy if you can't afford the high quality stuff).<br /><br />The kibble is large in size but I actually prefer it that way..when the cats come in from a long day outside they are ravenous and the large size of the kibble helps them slow down and actually break it apart..I have never seen them throw up a hairball from this food like they used to from other dry foods and that is saying A LOT! I got so used to wet messes on the floor and now there are none! Add in the the wet food from time and time (not daily) and the kibble becomes easier to eat for them. It keeps their teeth very clean in it's pure form though.<br /><br />All in all I have ordered this bag 3 times now this year since I discovered it and it's saved me a lot of money and a lot of time and my cats are not overweight or lacking in any way. No allergies, shiny coats and full of energy..I simply can't find a reason to complain."

I love Viva Coco plain and with Pineapple and Mango mixes, but mostly I use it as a work-out drink. This particular one is so sweet that I can barely stomack it. It also doesn't have much flavor or acidity which makes the sweetness even worse. After I'm done with this case, it's back to plan coconut water for me."

We purchased other brands of freeze dried fruit that was light and airy and quite wonderful.  This brand was nothing like the others we tried.  All the pieces were hard and hurt my teeth.  The apple pieces were more peels than actual fruit.  The one larger apple piece was actually a core piece that contained a SEED!  I will never buy this brand again.  It was a total disappointment and waste of money."

I had read wonderful reviews of Dirty Sue's and was pleased to see I could get it through Amazon and not pay the expensive shipping from the dirty sue website.  So yippee, I went ahead and bought the 4 pack.  Now I probably have three more bottles than I care to have.<br /><br />Its not that its bad.  Its just not what I've come accustomed to when adding olive juice to my martini from the Goya olive jar.  The dirty sue is a subtler flavor and lacks the zest and salt of the juice from the jar.<br /><br />If you're expecting it to be the same as what you've been having from your olives but without the olives, than think twice before ordering all 4 bottles."

It does taste ok, although you do NOT get a big vanilla flavor with it, but that is ok too. My only problem, it does leave an aftertaste. Maybe it is me because I am so used to my creamers, but I had my daughter try it and she had one too. I guess I will stick to my creamer/Splenda for now. Would love to retry if they can work on the aftertaste problem."

Whole grain rolled oats, brown rice flour, brown rice syrup, expeller-pressed safflower oil, molasses and vitamin E all mixed together with chocolate chips.  Delicious!<br /><br />I like the crunch and the flavor of Back To Nature Chocolate Delight Granola, and the fact that it is an easy, portable snack.  It is also really tasty in a yogurt parfait."

238789,B000633RJC,2.0,"We brought home an 7.5 week old lab puppy and bought purina puppy chow since that is what the breeder was feeding him. He got a total of 2 cups a day split between 3 different feeding times. We didn't have any issues the first couple of days, but then we started noticing that our lab would dry heave in the middle of the night. It progressively got worse and worse to where it was happening every night or multiple times at night. When we took him to the vet she said that he was a little chunky for his age of 9 weeks old. We ended up switching him to a ""holistic"" brand of puppy chow and haven't had any dry heaving at night since even though he is fed the exact same amount, at the same time of day as when we had him on purina. Of course I am not an expert, but I think that purina puppy chow did not have the right nutrients for our puppy. It did bulk him up, a little too much according to the vet, but didn't have enough calories to really sustain him, especially at night. I am giving this two stars because I could tell our puppy LOVED the taste of the food and it didn't give him gas like his current food does."
153447,B000EH4ELU,3.0,I really do like these to snack on however I'm really put off by the fact that this company always imports their ingredients from China. I'm Asian and I just never purchase food products from China. Most Asians don't purchase food from China either. I know these are not made in China however you just never know what type of pesticides and what kind of contaminants are in their soil that inevitable ends up in nuts and fruits used in these products. Just to err on the side of caution I will not be purchasing this product again.

For years I only drank soda and that's not healthy so I wanted something with flavor to satify my taste but not expand my waist.I recieved this as a sample from facebook about a year ago and it is all I drink. it cost less than 4.00 a bottle at Target where I am at so amazon charging about 6.00 is a rip so try to find it elsewhere first. If anything email mio  and find out where they have it avalable in your area. I also love it cause you can control the amount you use in your water and small enough to carry with you!!

They combing having an interesting taste, with an interesting texture as well. The flavour is fruity, tropical in a way. They are pretty chewy, and not too soft (like alot of cheaper gummies), and combing a smooth, chewy texture on top, with a slightly softer, marshmallowy bottom. I will always like these."

This review is purely what I think tastes best (I'm not a nutritionist, so I'm not going to try and compare which is better for you).<br /><br />I suppose I like Pecans better than Almonds.  I also think the Cinnamon Special K flakes taste a lot better, and stay crisper in milk longer than the Cinnamon Raisin Bran flakes do, and the Special K flakes have more cinnamon glaze on them than the Bran flakes do."

That was NOT the case with me. I took it before bed and about ten hours later I got horrible gas and cramping which led to me hurrying to the bathroom soon afterwards for a very crampy and unpleasant bowel movement. I would definitely give it a try if you haven't because it works very well. Its just a matter of figuring out how the tea is going to effect you personally."

240431,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"Purina Beneful has not been out for long, but it has become hugely popular!  My sister just switched her dog to it this summer, because he was having some stomach issues; she thought a new dog food might be a good idea.  (His stomach issues quit right before she switched, though.)  She was feeding <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDEI6W"">Purina One Chicken & Rice Dog Food, 4-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, which is an excellent dog food, with meat as the first ingredient.  Corn is the first ingredient in Beneful.  Corn is a filler food, and not really good for dogs, cats, ferrets, etc.  Yet, so many animal feeds have it, including many of the outrageously expensive Science Diets.  And so many pets have eaten corn based food their entire lives, and lived a long,long time.  You could go nuts figuring out what to feed your pets!  (Oh, and don't feed your ferrets nuts!)  Personally, I think Purina One is a far superior feed over Beneful.  That's what I feed my cats--<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AH3RN"">Purina One Cat Smartblend Chicken and Rice Cat Food, 16-Pound</a>.  (Oh, and my ferrets, too--<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AH3RP"">Purina One Kitten Growth & Dev, 7-Pounds</a>.)

I swallowed about three gulps and poured out the rest into the sink. It has a very strong after taste. Yuk.  Thankfully, I only received one packet of this stuff.  I would never pay a dollar per packet for this stuff.  The contents say this has acai and green tea leaf extract as the main ingredients.  I think the energy boost is supposed to come from caffine in the green tea. I didn't feel anything, but of course, I poured most of it into the sink."
254028,B000JZ3576,2.0,"First off I would like to say that I thought long and hard about buying this. I read other reviews claiming these were ""stale"" and ""not stored well"" and I would like to say this is 100% correct. You might not notice it very much, but it is correct. The airheads are not gooey and chewy like they should be. I got several hard lumps of something in many of them. There was no green apple flavor, only mystery, watermelon, blue raspberry, cherry, orange and pink lemonade. The orange and cherry had the most problem with deformation (melted and then hardened into different forms).<br />The flaws with these airheads are subtle and will only apparent to an airhead connoisseur. If you don't mind these very subtle flaws and love airheads, buy this! But if you want fresh delicious airheads buy them elsewhere."

This made an excellent gift as well as an excellent drink....just add any booze..it's wonderful!  Does not upset my stomach like pre-mixed sweet-n-sour - that stuff that comes in the bottle..this is WAY better"
124787,B004AQDCPA,1.0,"I found this Harissa Paste somewhat overpowering as compared to others that I have tried.  Though a subjective matter, it was not to my taste and I ended up throwing away half a jar."
254625,B000UXW98S,2.0,"I love the container these come in much more then the bagged olives sold at Amazon, but the taste is not nearly as good as those olives.  They are way too salty to eat alone.  The texture is fine as well as the quality, but the salt is just too much.  I like salty olives, but these cross the line.  I'd recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAPLS6"">Byzantine Country Olives, 5 Pound Bag</a>which are much better."
129871,B0002CRZRW,1.0,"It doesn't taste like green tea, maybe a little bit like gemaicha? I don't like this tea, and throw away it to trash after drinking several cups. Not sure what reason, I felt dizzy and discomfortable after drinking it. Don't buy it."
80922,B0029JW9JU,4.0,"Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great ""seasoning"" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture."
76638,B0049ULB78,4.0,"I like a robust coffee, and for a k-cup, this very nearly delivers the flavor and strength I like.  I would buy it again."
17277,B005ZHC8TE,5.0,"these are lower in fat and calories than chips and seem to satisfy better than regular chips.  Try them, you'll like em"
164310,B002915VF2,3.0,"If this had the same amount of calories as ice cream, or even frozen yogurt, I would be giving the product 1 star. However, part of the appeal of Arctic Zero is that it is so low in calories. It is important to note that this is not ice cream nor does it taste like ice cream. I found that when I ate it straight out of the carton, it had a slightly weird aftertaste.<br />My advice to anyone who orders Arctic Zero is that you should go into it with the idea that you're going to get a frozen protein shake rather than the idea that you're going to get an amazing ice cream for only 64 calories for a cup. That would be too good to be true.<br />While I wouldn't eat Arctic Zero (at least not the chocolate peanut butter, which is the only flavor that I've tried) plain, I found that it does make for a good base for shakes (although, I would probably not purchase this product again). When I mixed it with a few other ingredients like milk, ice, fruit, cocoa powder, better 'n peanut butter, etc. I found that the strange aftertaste disappeared and I was left with a distinct chocolate flavor with a hint of peanut in the background.<br />Again, I will warn you, do not spend the money for this product if you're hoping to find a low calorie ice cream substitute. As I stated above, that's not what you're going to get!<br /><br />Edited to add: I have to add one thing that I'm hoping that I'm wrong about. I'm wondering if the company is writing some product reviews to encourage (or mislead) others to buy their product. I certainly don't want to point the finger at anyone. However, I find it hard to believe that there are so many reviews that state that the product tastes like a rich and decadent desert. I find it hard to believe that anyone would claim that this product is mind-blowingly good or that it could be compared to regular ice cream, unless they had something to gain by doing so. Read the reviews for yourself and pay attention to the dates in which they were written as well as the fact that the good reviews seem to be rated as helpful, whereas the bad reviews are frequently either rated as unhelpful or are commented on by someone who seems to be invested in Arctic Zero. Perhaps I am wrong, as I have no real evidence to support my assumption. However, something doesn't seem quite right, and that needs to be addressed considering how pricey the product is."
128799,B0032GREWQ,1.0,"I agree with all of the reviews here (except for the one that gave PB's two stars; should have been one star, like the rest of them).  I tried to give it zero stars, but it wouldn't work.<br /><br />I have been making Potato Buds for many years.  It has been my favorite brand and I have tried many.  I made my own slight changes to the instructions on the box to suit my taste and got accustomed to making them the same way every time.<br /><br />But ever since Betty Crocker changed the formula, there is no way I can make these taste good.  They used to be tasty real flakes of dehydrated potato, now it's more like a bland powder.<br /><br />I just came today to Amazon to try and find the old formula and didn't realize until now that so many feel the same way I do about the present formula.<br /><br />I have no idea why they changed it and I can't believe they are blaming the consumers for the bad taste.<br /><br />These are horrible and I am going to be another of the many who are going to find another brand.<br /><br />Maybe if enough people abandon buying these, BC will get the message and change them back to the way they were before, but I'm not holding my breath.  But I did have to hold my nose while eating these."
77728,B001LG940E,4.0,"For a soda that has no sugar added and no preservatives, this stuff is pretty good.  The Black Cherry flavor is strong but not overpowering.  The carbonation level is just right.  There is a very slight aftertaste but not enough to really bother, just enough to keep this from being a 5 star review. For an 8.3 oz. can it has 130 calories, 0 fat, 15mg of sodium, 35g of carbs, 33g of sugar, and 0 protein. Recommended as a healthy alternative to sugar laden soda or to taste absent diet soda."
167384,B007PE7ANY,3.0,It was ok just not what I was expecting. So I won't say yes or no you have to try for yourself.
77660,B001LG940E,4.0,"Thank goodness a carbonated drink that is tasty without all the additives.  Taste like the cherry drinks out there, but slightly lighter in flavoring and not too empowering.  although the can is less than half the volume of a normal can, I do wonder why when things are this good for you that it comes in a such small size?  At least it is in a can that can be recycled."
16755,B001LGGH40,5.0,This drink is a nice change of pace from soda.  It is an all NATURAL beverage with NO JUNK IN IT.  It is made only of juice and carbonation and that is it.  We couldn't believe it when we tried it!  It tastes really great and if I were looking for a drink without caffeine I would choose this.  The Switch is really tasty and satisfying.  I also liked that the carbonation is not quite as heavy as some sodas.  My family of four tried it and we all decided that we would buy this brand again.
154797,B0014WYXTC,3.0,"This was a split in the family - my husband and son did not notice a metal taste - but my daughter and I could taste it overwhelmingly! I drink Poland Spring Seltzer lemon flavor etc... from cans so that isn't the issue.  I've had this same soda in bottles and love the taste - especially the grapefruit!  This has much less sugar than regular soda and is organic.  But, did you know it is made by PEPSI??  I didn't until I wrote to the company online to tell them about the metal taste and received an email back from PEPSI. It is a tad deceiving for the IZZE company to claim to be its own entity when it is owned and operated by PEPSI.  Maybe it is like many of these organic companies who were bought out by the big giants - unable to make it on their own...<br />But, the metal taste was so bad we were unable to drink ANY of them!"
17074,B000F2VESU,5.0,"This is good sticky rice which is indeed very sticky, in fact it congeals together even to make nice sticky mush.  I have cooked it with just water in my Zojirushi rice cooker and it turns out all right.  It tastes even better with some artifical sweetener.  I'm sure sugar would taste better still but I'm trying to trim down.<br /><br />This with coconut milk and sugar or artifical sugar in a rice cooker should turn out very tasty sticky rice.  I recommend this item even thought it is a tad costly at this price point, but not so bad with free shipping by Amazon Prime."
161755,B000LKX01K,3.0,For some reason these seeds did not agree with me.  I wish for something with some flavor but these won't work for me.

They look fabulous, they smell even better, they were fresh, they were attractive looking...................the problem? My 2 Yorkies won't touch them........sniff them and then walk away........even cut up in little pieces. I'll have to give them away unless I get desperate for cookies and decide to eat them myself!"
16521,B003VZCZ0O,5.0,"They're magically delicious.<br /><br />Okay...but seriously ... great price, cereal arrived promptly and in good shape.  I especially like the Amazon automatic shipment program for cereals:  it gives you an additional 15% discount, you set the shipment intervals and you can cancel at any time.  Go for it!"
80819,B003DMXDGA,4.0,while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.  I like them.  Light and they  do not upset the system with additives and colorings.  A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat.  I would buy them again.  No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.
250603,B002YR7A78,2.0,"This is not the first time I ordered this item, unfortunately, this time it came in a bag with a quarter size hole in it, creating a huge mess while i was trying to open an amazon box. The outside box was the right size, so I believe the couscous bag was already damaged before it was placed in a box. They should use heavy duty bags! To make the matter worse, Amazon does not accept this item back, which does not make any sense! I will not order it again."
128278,B0001590IC,1.0,"While it does have the flavor, it also has an after taste that the organic product does not.  The fair trade organic version is a little more costly, however their process is different and it gives a crisper cleaner taste than this product offers.  I thought I could save a little money, turns out like most things, you get what you pay for.  Equal Exchange carries the organic, fair trade verison if you want to try it)"
136866,B001ACPPXE,1.0,"Great that they are gluten free. Unfortunately, they are flavor free.  If you didn't add the butter or sugar as recommended they would be softened cardboard.  They do not turn out as pretty as the box cover.  Not very impressed."
136567,B006Q820X0,1.0,"[Update: Brooklyn Beans sent me a new box - as you can see in the comments below. 1 out of 24 cups was not sealed. I have now learned to squeeze the k-cup just slightly to see if the foil lid responds to the light pressure. If it bulges just a little, the lid is good. If it is loose, I pull the lid off and brew it in My K-Cup coffee filter so at least the coffee is not wasted. The coffee is very good. My favorite was Brooklyn Bridge Blend. But all of it was fresh and tasty. ]<br /><br />7 out of 36 cups are not sealed. I do not think the box was compressed in shipping causing some of the cups to burst. No cups were crunched. The BB box looks fine - undented. It was inside an Amazon box which also looked fine - all still-puffy airpillows inside. There was loose coffee in both boxes and coffee dust on  the k-cups and airpillows.<br /><br />The k-cups that have a good lid  look roughly made to me. The logo printing<br /> doesn't line up with the top of the cups. The edges of the foil is rough. Where the foil is sealed on the cup the foil feels bumpy... like loose coffee was not cleaned off the cup before the foil was applied.<br /><br />I haven't made any coffee yet. I will up date this review when I do tomorrow morning... but right now, already 7 cups down, I am not impressed.<br /><br />I rarely write bad reviews, but I do not want anyone else to be disappointed like I am right now."

While the Velveeta is a cheese sauce packet, rather than powdered cheese, I found it lacked flavor. It just seemed bland. Needed more cheesy flavor or more salt or _something_. It was really not much better than eating plain macaroni.<br /><br />There were one or two shells that didn't get cooked all the way through too. I'll probably eat the other 3 cups, but I won't be buying it again."

My dogs have no trouble moving the tiles.<br /><br />And therein les the problem. Every dog I have tried this with is vastly entertained--for about two minutes. My Golden, two German Sheperd puppies, and a Havanese all mastered this toy almost instantly, so it does nothing at all to keep them occupied on their own. Even still, I would probably still give it four stars for its fun factor, but the price is too high for its function.<br /><br />If you are going to sit around and refill it over and over again to let your dog play with for longer than two minutes, use a Manners Minder instead. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B8CHG"">Premier Manners Minder Remote Reward Behavior Training System for Dogs</a> You can use it to train all sorts of things and dogs think it's Christmas with a remote control.

If you want the flavor combination then I recommend the regular soy butter (the crunchy version is also delicious!) and either sprinkle chocolate chips on it (try it! you won't regret it!) or for some serious indulging drizzle with a little left over ganache!

237089,B004ZU0RAE,2.0,Bought two packs of these bottles a few months ago at Sears. Was interested in a bottle with an angled neck to ensure baby wasn't sucking air; and one that was BPA free. Baby just started drinking about 4 ounces per serving so I just started using these bottles a few days ago only to discover a) the caps protecting the nipple don't stay on securely b)milk leaks out at the neck of the bottle and can be the cause of unexpected outfit changes. These 2 areas need improvement!!! Apart from that the bottles are cute and attempt to offer good features but miss the mark on the basics. I am now on the hunt for new bottles and would not recommend this product.

I am ok if it is made in China like most of the pet products, I trust your quality control until proven otherwise. I trust an honest effort to make good quality products and inform the customers.<br />If it matters to the producing company, I would rather not feed my best friend with something treated by nuclear radiation. Steam it, freeze dry it, but don't nuke it and leave it natural. If a restaurant would sell you irradiated food, would you consider safe for you?<br /><br />To me, if advertised looking like natural, it must be exactly that, no sneaky fine prints on the back.<br />If the producing company would offer such alternatives (non-irradiated) I would reconsider the review and would buy again this product.

I always cut the bag open and poured it into a container, so I couldn't check the ingredient label.  In desperation, I went to the supermarket and looked at the bag.  Sure enough, Bob mixes ""GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR"" into this mix.  So caution, if you like bean-tasting food, then this is the best flour for you!!

77122,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Back To Nature's Chocolate Delight Granola is a great tasting snack, but kind of difficult to eat because it doesn't really come in clusters.  It's more like a loose granola cereal with little chocolate rectangles in it.  Probably the best way to eat it would be by pouring it in a bowl and eating it with a spoon.<br /><br />That said, it has 28g of whole grain and 4g of dietary fiber.  Like most granolas, it has a lot of fat, 6g, but no trans fat.  Each half cup serving contains 220 calories, of which 50 are from fat.  The allergy info states that it contains soy and milk and is manufactured on equipment that processes wheat.<br /><br />I thought it had a very pleasant granola/chocolate aroma and a pleasingly sweet taste with good mouth texture and a satisfying crunch.  If they could just get it to hold together in clusters so that people can eat it without having to resort to spoons, it would be a five star product!"
153337,B001D3PXQ4,3.0,"My girlfriend loves this gum and told me she cannot find it anywhere, so I preceded to place a large online order. The next day I was at the local grocery store and found about 50 3-packs of this gum in the sale aisle. It was also available at Target. Moral of the story, if you dont feel like waiting for amazon to ship it, just drive to your grocery store. I was also told you can't keep the gum in the plastic container in your car in the summer bc it would melt.....NOT TRUE..."
166413,B0033UDZ9W,3.0,"After soaking in milk or half-and-half, this isn't as tasty as Seitenbacher Muesli #1 Natural Body Power with European Hazelnuts.  It becomes too soggy.<br /><br />Maybe if you eat it like Granola it's better.  But I like mine with milk and cream.<br /><br />Check out Seitenbacher Muesli #1 Natural Body Power with European Hazelnuts, also on Amazon.  The Hazelnuts are so good.  And the apple slices have a great texture."
150693,B004S04XA6,3.0,"A little disappointed.  The ravioli taste OK, but too few of them.  Product has a lot of liquid; and although it has a pretty good flavor, there is a lot more of it than is needed for the amount of pasta.  Best if combined with vegetable to absorb all the excess sauce.  I use sweet potato, mashed."
125124,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"I have to agree with the majority here.  The new 70% bar, made in N.H., is just a Hershey bar in a fancy package.  Don't even bother.  In fact, once I tried it, I returned the 8 I bought on sale locally and exchanged them for the 85% bar.  The 85% is still made in France with the ""old recipe"" and has no soy lecithin.  Comments about the 70% bar being ""greasy"" and ""plastic"" are correct.  But let's be frank... no serious chocolate connoisseur would consider any Lindt bar worthy.  If you're serious about chocolate, look towards Michel Cluizel, Valrhona, Bonnat and others."
17333,B000EVIDUY,5.0,"We have been baking these brownies for several years as I have a gluten-free son who is the pickiest of eaters.  If there was a change to the recipe when the company was acquired by Glutino, it did not affect its taste to our family!<br /><br />These are fudgey and chewy not at all dry or cake-like.  We tried freezing them to make them last longer, but they are just as good if not better frozen.  We cut ours after baking and freeze them already cut in a zip-lock bag.<br /><br />A few years ago, an organic living magazine did a taste-test on all brownies and these placed first.  Incidentally, Gluten-Free's chocolate cake mix which used to be called Danielle's decadent cake mix also took first place and it makes the best chocolate cupcakes I have ever eaten!  Try topping them with Pamela's dark chocolate frosting mix. The best!  NO ONE will ever suspect either mix is gluten-free."
127701,B001BOVE54,1.0,"When I first started my 3 cats on Wellness Core, I thought it was fabulous. Suddenly their fur was shiny and bright! They liked it, too! But then reality set in... A couple of bags later, all of my cats were losing their fur in massively scary amounts. I'm not talking basic shedding, either. Their fur was falling out..everywhere. This food was causing excessive hair loss all over their bodies..on ALL my cats!!! I was really worried, because it was bad. The rep at Petco told me when I informed her of this problem that other customers had noticed the same problem in their cats. I've read other reviews, as well, where people complained about a ""hairball problem"" with this food. This was no ordinary ""hairball"" problem, let me tell you. In addition, this food is absolutely NOT for cats with weight gain tendencies. I reduced my 15 lb male cat's daily intake to WELL UNDER 1/2c of this stuff plus a TBS of canned daily, and he STILL gained weight on it! My opinion is there is some vital problem with this food that would cause such hairloss. Either there is an ingredient in it that should NOT be there, or there is something missing that SHOULD be there.<br />The Wellness regular dry w/ grains caused flakes in my cats, as well. The Wellness canned is the only thing I highly recommend from Wellness."
82197,B00926990U,4.0,This coffee is a good buy for someone who likes cream in their cup.  Its more of a mellow flavor than a medium roast.  Cheep enuff to at least give it a try.

240991,B000NBQUNW,2.0,"I bought these because it seemed a compelling way to get plant stanols, which medical literature praise for their cholesterol reducing abilities.  I don't consume a lot of bread, so the benecol/stanol butter substitute spreads were not a reliable source of stanols for me.<br /><br />However, these chews aren't all they are cracked up to be.  If you have 4 chews per day (like they suggest), you get 16 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar, and 80 calories!  For anyone who has high cholesterol + high triglycerides, that isn't a desirable way to get your stanols.  Even if these lower your cholesterol, the offsetting risk to your triglycerides might negate the heart healthy benefits.  I'm no expert on this, but I find that eating too many sugars only makes me hungrier.<br /><br />If you like to have spreads on your breads and are using stanols as part of your heart health regimen, I'd suggest a tub of Benecol or Smart Balance instead!<br /><br />Benecol - can you bring me stanols in a capsule without the sugar?"
249684,B001LGGH54,2.0,"I have concerns with this product that would prevent me from buying.  It has more calories and sugar than regular coke and was much too sweet for my taste.  The strawberry flavor was not subtle but had a ""bite"".  All this might be OK if it tasted terrific; however, it doesn't to me at all.  It tastes sort of candyish--or like someone carbonated strawberry jelly. And it costs almost a dollar a can...."

239833,B000KEPBCS,2.0,"Recently started a gluten free diet.  Have to say, I was hoping for a lot more from something that claimed ""all-purpose"" .  First use was in pancakes.  Now, I like garbanzo beans, but the garbanzo/fava bean flour in here was overpowering in it's taste.  Sorghum or rice flour w white/bean flour is much closer to what I'd consider as ""all-purpose"" to get a good protein content."
131460,B003JNAOME,1.0,"I used to love the blue packaged m&m's when they were first released in the early 2000's. Then one day, without notice, the Mars company decided to change the content from crispy to pretzel. For years I've search for the real blue packaged ones only to be upset and angered every time I walk out of a 7-11 and spot these crunchless crimes against humanity.<br /><br />I tried contacting the Mars family by both phone and mail multiple times, the only thing I got in return was a restraining order! This product and company have caused me so much stress that I have developed a brain tumor which doctors are now checking for cancer.<br /><br />Learn from my experience and boycott this godless candy. The normal ones are okay though, they melt in your mouth and not in your hand."
81713,B001VDXO3K,4.0,"Great product but I must agree with other reviewers about packaging - ordered two cases. One was fine. The other one had one of the corners of one of six cartons frayed and about half a cup of cocowater made the packaging damp. Not sure how it gets frayed as it was packaged inside two other boxes... Great product, bad packaging.<br /><br />Looks like Amazon is doing something about it since the item is under review. Kudos to them!"

161367,B007P2OQC4,3.0,"I tried this because I thought that it might be a useful healthy snack to keep at work.  Tried it at home as a cereal.  It's certainly nutrient-dense, high fiber, low sugar and no salt - and not at all tasty.  Couldn't really taste the banana flavor and that's what I bought it for.  I had to add a lot of honey in order to choke it down, which kind of nullifies the low-sugar low-calorie benefit.<br /><br />If you're okay with granola that has no sweetness whatsoever than this is a good product for you. Just not for me."
82294,B0060JMVM0,4.0,"The price and quality of this product are both fantastic. I love that the dark, tin container greatly protects the taste and integrity of the oil (versus the typical glass bottle). However, there is an inherent problem with the pouring spout. It is plastic and very short. This leads to oil dripping on the top during usage, which is both wasteful and messy. If the manufacturer would alter that one component, this would be the perfect organic olive oil."
80719,B0001M0YWQ,4.0,"Frontier product has always been reliable.  The bag of turmeric had a small tear in the side of the bag and the supplier put a piece of scotch tape over the tear to keep it from leaking, which I was a bit skeptic about.  All in all the turmeric is working well.  I am putting it in capsules and using it for pain."
124950,B000V9SN2W,1.0,I was hoping for a smooth flavor.  No such luck.  This coffee is very bitter.  Have tried different brewing quantities and all is a disappointment.  Will never purchase again.

Not to mention the Folgers select are always a few bucks less then the other premium coffees. For some reason the selection at my local stores has dwindled and they don't have this blend. They only have the funky flavored blends. Don't know if this is from Folgers' end or Walmart's continuing limitation of product selection. Love this coffee, hope is stays around."
152187,B00066CRXG,3.0,"I was a real fan of this line of dog treats until one day, I noticed on the back of the bag, the fine print, that read, ""MADE IN CHINA"". How can a dog treat that states cage free chickens and all natural come from China? Its rare to hear of a cage free chicken coup in China of all places. And the standards of inspection are quite lax to say the least. I have since found better alternatives that I can be more comfortable in giving my dog, such as Plato Natural Organic Chicken made here in the USA."
149938,B0028C44IM,3.0,"We love Eclipse mints, but the Spearmint flavor is too spicy for my family (tastes more like a peppermint).  We prefer the Winterfrost- it's minty but milder than the Spearmint."
245588,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"I guess I was also disappointed in the assortment.  The info suggests you get 34 different coffees, so that you don't have to ""buy 34 different boxes.""  But as others reported, I got repeats in the assortment, as many as 4 of the exact same product.  Furthermore, I received two CIDER products, which are not coffee.  I don't want cider, I want coffee.  And thanks for the iced coffee sample, which I also don't drink.  Lastly, the k-cups are packaged in a brown paper bag which is stapled shut.  I'm guessing that doesn't even meet food packaging codes; there's no product info, ingredient info or nutrition info."

131000,B005MWASW6,1.0,This product contains artificial sweeteners.  The smell when it is being cooked or even when it is still dry is overwhelmingly unpleasant and chemical-ish. The artificial sweeteners are VERY obvious in the taste. I bought to keep at work for when I forget a meal but it took me a long time to finish and I wont buy it again because of the chemical smell and taste.  Right now the empty bowl smells strongly of syrupy sweetener and that was after I dumped a tablespoon of peanut butter in it to cover it up.  I like to keep Quaker instants for hurried days but I will not buy this line again.  It just tastes and smells... odd.
252114,B004WZ4EVK,2.0,"Like dried flakes of seaweed. Very 'fishy' in smell. Lots of packaging for only a few ""flakes"" of chips. Would not buy again and would not recommend to others depsite the low calories!"
17769,B001EQ4LAE,5.0,This mix is easy to make and tastes delicious.  It is moist and chewy.  It satisfies those that eat gluten as well!  My second favorite brownie mix is by Authentic Foods and all the others I have tried and would not make again - they went in the trash can.
234167,B00113HADA,2.0,"I saw all the positive reviews so I thought I'd give this a try since it's a bit cheaper than my other favorite brands. Unfortunately, I'll have to disagree with the other reviewers, for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) To me, this doesn't taste like jasmine blossoms. Instead, it tastes and smells like artificial banana flavoring -- like what you'd find in banana-flavored chewing gum or Jelly Bellies. I don't even care for real bananas all that much, so this is definitely not a good thing.<br /><br />2) Speaking of flavoring -- the list of ingredients says ""Organic Jasmine Green Tea and Organic Flavor."" What the heck is ""Organic Flavor""? Oh, they must mean ""organic artificial-banana flavoring."" ;)<br /><br />3) The strings of the tea bags are attached to the bag with a mini-staple. First off, I'm not too keen on the idea of brewing metal staples along with my tea. Second, one of the strings detached from its bag because the staple didn't hold it in place well enough -- and this happened the very first time I tried this tea. The detached string was a minor annoyance, but what if the staple itself detached from the bag and into the tea? It's small enough that it could be inadvertently swallowed.<br /><br />I think it's worth paying a little more for these (both of which I've tried and like):<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028SWA7S"">Choice Organic Whole Leaf Organics Jasmine Green Tea Pyramids, 15-Count, 1.05-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E20E"">Rishi Tea Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea, 2.99-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a>"
76931,B001OCKIP0,4.0,My kids and I enjoyed this granola. It had a nice fresh taste (unless some of the stale tasting ones we have had). The chocolate chucks were a bonus for my daughter who normally doesn't eat granola. I put it over homemade ice cream and they gobbled it up. I ate it as cereal with milk and enjoyed it. I have been happy with every Back to Nature product I have purchased and this is no exception. I would buy it again.
130637,B001M29OAM,1.0,"If you are a serious coffee drinker, this is not the one for you. With the k-cup technology, it's not as though you have to practice making coffee as the work is done for you. Whether on the smallest or middle setting, I can't taste coffee! To me, it's Dark Water. If I could have rated it 0 stars, I would have. I tried but I kept getting the request to rate the coffee. For me, it has 0 stars."
79349,B003TNANSO,4.0,I love these bars. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is their price. I tried to save money by buying them here instead of store but it turns out the difference in price is nearly irrelevant.... Cheaper but not as much as you would think.anyway taste and quality is great.
17196,B006JG8ALK,5.0,"these bars are very filling and very tasty!  I originally found them at Marshalls and was thrilled to find them in bulk here on amazon.com.  They're great for on the go days, and they really are filling."

168425,B0001ES9F8,3.0,This is the only Senseo product I have found that makes an almost strong enough mug of coffee.  All others require 2 pods for a 12 oz. mug and that gets rather pricy and wasteful.
248243,B003X0WNAE,2.0,"I was very dissappointed in the taste. It is rather bland, weak brew and not bold at all. To have started with such a great bean and ended up with such a weak taste is a real shame. Especially with 72 of them to deal with now.<br /><br />Finally, they say you only need one pod, because they made them too big. Talk about making virtue of necessity. You can only fit one pod in the two pod attachment. The best you can do is to use the two pod attachment and brew one 4 oz cup at a time. Then put in another pod and brew the 2nd 4 oz."
127905,B0025UCB2I,1.0,"I got a box full of mayonnaise packets, and there likely are about 200 in there (I'm not going to count them) but they are NOT the Heinz mayonnaise packets pictured. They are a generic 'Mayonnaise' packet (blue lettering on white background) - the same kind I used to have in my office's break room in the early 1990s. I don't doubt they'll taste fine as far as mayonnaise goes, but it's not what is advertised.<br /><br />Another issue is that there are no expiration dates, either on the box or the packets themselves. This would be helpful information to have as we are storing these for use with canned chicken and tuna for emergency food storage. There is only a production date, so I will have to use my own judgement on how long mayo is likely good after being produced!"

154687,B000LKZ8B0,3.0,I bought these because someone said they were better than Country Choice.  To me they are not as tasty and have less texture.  But the price seems better.  I don't think I will ever finish them even though I eat oatmeal almost every day.
125246,B001E5DXFO,1.0,"I took a risk and ordered the mango flavor, hoping that some of the reviews would be wrong and this product would be as described - that is, a relatively healthy smoothie mix.  Alas, that was not the case.<br /><br />This smoothie mix is basically sugar syrup with maybe (I'm still dubious on this one) a little bit of fruit mixed in.  The mango mix is BRIGHT orange and SICKLY sweet.  They WAY overdid it on the sugar.  I couldn't even finish the first smoothie I made because it was way too sweet.<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer noted (not sure which flavor was being reviewed then), the ingredients for the mango product are also not as listed in the nutritional info on the product page.  I think part of the problem is that the product picture (and probably also nutritional info) are actually for a different product, the MANGO GUAVA flavor.  I ordered and received the MANGO MADNESS product, with no guava listed in the ingredients.  But my main beef is the type and relative amount of sugar was misrepresented.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients and nutritional info from the product page:<br /><br />Ingredients: MANGO PUREE, BEET SUGAR, TEA INFUSION (FILTERED WATER, GREEN TEA), NATURAL MANGO AND GUAVA FLAVORS, VEGETABLE GUM, CITRIC ACID, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C) YELLOW 6, SODIUM BENZOATE (TO PRESERVE FRESHNESS).<br />Calories 110<br />Total Carbohydrate 28g (9%)<br />Sugars 27g<br /><br />And here is the info from the actual product label:<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, water, mango puree concentrate, malic acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), natural flavors, green tea powder, potassium sorbate (preservative), sodium benzoate (preservative), cellulose gum, yellow #5, and yellow #6<br />Calories 140<br />Total carbohydrate 36g<br />Sugars 35g<br />Also note that the nutritional info directly above is for 1/4 cup of smoothie base.  Of course, the directions on the side of the bottle instruct you to add 4oz of smoothie base to generate a 16oz serving.  So, you're really getting 54g of sugar in each smoothie.<br /><br />Wish I had received the product that was promised, it sounded like a great product. Instead, I'll be trying to return this if I can.  Very disappointed in this purchase."
131373,B000H10IK4,1.0,I have ordered this item in the past. It shipped exactly as shown and it was a decent quality of matcha.

248248,B002HTQO5M,2.0,"First off, I should thank the generous people at Tabasco for including a free jar of their salsa with my purchase of 1/2 gallon of Chipotle Tabasco sauce. But, after the first taste of their salsa, my first thought was, ""There must be some mistake."" There is now way this sauce is what Tabasco considers ""Hot"" salsa. If you think I am hardcore pepperhead, I'm not. To exaggerate a little, I've had marinara sauce that is as spicy as this salsa. And not only is this sauce so mildly spiced, it is surprisingly sweet. I say surprisingly because, how could a company that has established it's name based on their tangy (vinegary) hot sauce make such a sweet salsa. I will admit this salsa doesn't rank among the worst tasting salsa's I have tried (in the mild category, where it belongs,) but when I first pulled this jar out of the package I couldn't help but get my hopes up in all regards. But, then again, maybe that is the reason I received this as a free gift, perhaps my initial thoughts were true."

137601,B0018CFQLC,1.0,My cat became ill like another poster and was vomiting throughout the day.<br />I am very concerned about this because she also has diarrhea now. This has never happened to me before so I will not be repurchasing.
17582,B0000GH6UQ,5.0,"A couple years ago, my husband pointed this cocoa out to me.  He hadn't tried it, but he'd always been amused by the granny's mischievous smile.  Since he'd been trading smirks with Abuelita for so long, I insisted we try it, and we haven't looked back.  Made with milk, the cocoa has a full flavor complemented by a nice, spicy accent.  Everything else now tastes bland by comparison."
245817,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"I knew going into it by reading the description that there would be repeats, but this was RIDICULOUS.  Way too much of my order were holiday flavored K-Cups (gingerbread, pumpkin and egg nog).  I got 6 gingerbread, 6 pumpkin and 6 egg nog.  Really?  I suppose that would be fine were I ordering during the winter/holiday time, but not in the middle of the summer.  The rest were pretty repeated, as well.  I wish I had counted, but I didn't - I would estimate I only got 6 DIFFERENT samples.  It was pretty disappointing and I would never order again.  As far as it coming in a paper bag: yes, it does.  But who cares?"
125512,B0016JKXGU,1.0,"This green tea is the worst I have purchased. I don't understand the good reviews. This has a smoke taste. It is not smooth or light at all. Lipton original green tea tastes better than this. This does not taste organic. At first I thought it was Lipton in a different package, but that would be insulting Lipton. Don't waste your money on this product, I have 5 boxes that will be tossed out.<br /><br />Best Green teas I have had:<br />1. Bigelow Organic<br />2. Celestial Seasonings Organic<br />3. Lipton Organic"
133436,B0090X8IPM,1.0,The taste is burning even when fresh and has no coffee aroma.  It is very unlike the usual quality I expect from Starbucks.
165422,B000G6BXAE,3.0,"More ""hot"" than BBQ which isn't a bad thing at all, but wish they had a little more bbq flavor."
17687,B000HTU1U8,5.0,"Delicious Marzipan. Niederegger makes the best marzipan. The assortment is lovely and very tasty. Although the portions are small, they are dense with flavor and richness, and are quite satisfying."
246243,B003TN8JEO,2.0,"I have been subscribing to this and other Kind products for over a year now, and have noticed that the bars are getting smaller and smaller, but the price keeps creeping up.<br /><br />It have become almost a game when the bars arrive: How much smaller are the bars going to be since the previous consignment of 3 months ago?  Maybe I should keep one from each shipment and compare its length when the next arrives.<br /><br />Of course the wrapper remains the same size, and that just adds to the fun.  I wonder if the bar will ever reduce to half the wrapper size.<br /><br />Apart from all this, the quality of the bars themselves has remained consistent, but the freshness varies from shipment to shipment."
152757,B001S1BP5O,3.0,"I tried this a few years ago, and thought it was great.  It's certainly much better than chocolate from your local grocery store.  Recently though, I've tried Ritter Sport, and have decided that it's better.  So for those of you who are looking for something that's better than what you can get at your local grocery store, you're definitely in for a treat with this, but you might want to  give Ritter a try also."
148703,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"Are there healthier choices for a snack bar? Yes. Are there better tasting choices for a snack bar? Yes. Is there a snack bar with more of a peanut taste? Eh, maybe. I wanted to suggest these for when you go hiking. However, with 220 calories, and 110 of those being fat calories, I'm not so sure I would suggest these for hiking. Factor in the 160mg of sodium, it seems counter productive. Health wise, I would suggest countless other bars. Taste wise, I don't see these bars replacing Blueberry Trio Bars in our snack drawer. As for peanuty taste, it's a toss up between these and a Payday bar. I would give the edge to the Planters Big Nut Bars just on the healthier factor.<br /><br />All in all, if you love peanuts, not worried about indulging, and don't mind a heavy feeling snack. Then by all means, this is a good choice for you."
136566,B006Q820X0,1.0,"these are horrible! there are always grounds in the bottom, it doesn't fill the cup, horrible packaging and inconsistent performance! DO NOT BUY!"
236744,B003IN848Q,2.0,"If you would like weak coffee use one packet if you would like a good, smooth coffee the two packets.  Wish I wouldve listened to prior reviewer.  It's good coffee but expensive if you need two packets to make one cup.  I'm going back to Mount Hagen instant packet coffees ....wonderful coffee flavor, not bitter and not weak.  Oh and cheaper."
82613,B000FA15D6,4.0,"We definitely enjoy Teddy Grahams in our house and for the most part these were good. The only issue I had was that the taste of the chocolate ones were a bit off, maybe a bit stale tasting. Otherwise these are a great, easy and convenient product."
167397,B007PE7ANY,3.0,"I enjoyed the flavor and contents of each bar.  And if the bars are kept in a cool place you can actually remove them from the wrapper.  Cool doesn't mean house temperature unless yours is 62 degrees.  Otherwise, if somewhat warmer the bars become extremely sticky and are hard to remove from the celephane wrappers.  Expect sticky licking-good fingers as well.  Were it not for that I'd give it a 4+-star."
246677,B000W7T4Y4,2.0,"Two of the six containers I received has a cracked and chipped lids and the aluminum foil sealer is torn. The packaging is really flimsy and thin, the lid cover is thin and easily cracked and chipped. The product however, is good but will not last very long if the packaging is not fixed. I will never order this item again unless the packaging is fixed."
80304,B004SKP0MG,4.0,WAS GREAT HOW FAST THE PRODUCT GOT HERE.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A PRODUCT GET HERE THAT FAST.  WAS PLEASED TO HAVE THE CANDY HERE ONLY PROBLEM WAS IT HAD MELTED BUT WE ARE STILL EATING IT.  THANKS AGAIN FOR BRINGING BACK A MEMORY FROM WHEN I WAS OVERSEAS IN THE ARMY.
18068,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"I am amazed at this product.  I didn't really expect it to be as good as it is.  Now, if they could only come up with a way for it to be crunchy, it would be perfect!  It's good as is (blended with water) and also as an addition to recipes calling for peanut butter.  This is an excellent product and a great way to enjoy peanut butter without the fat."
17973,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,My daughter loves this peanut butter.  It is low in fat and although it isn't exactly like peanut butter it is a great substitute.
126294,B000F8GWRM,1.0,"I was happy to find these in my local weis supermarket as I had never seen a sugar free option for the twizzlers and they are my favorite snack. I am very strict about eating the indicated serving size. I loved the taste, noticed no difference between these and the regular strawberry twizzlers made with sugar. One hour later I regretted eating these as I got horrible rumblings in my intestines and spent a few hours going to the bathroom with very bad diarrhea. This was like taking pure laxatives. Do not get this as it is not good for your health. You're better off getting the ones with sugar and just eating half the serving size of you want twizzlers."
150695,B004S04XA6,3.0,"Most of these meals have too much salt. This one could use just a bit more salt, and a bit less spice.<br /><br />The trick with this one is to let it sit a bit out of the microwave so the heat spreads more evenly, or you'll burn your mouth on the hot spots.<br /><br />This is a decent dish. Add a little salt and some grated cheese and it's even better."
151140,B001Q9EFW8,3.0,"These biscuits are huge, almost a meal. We have 3 dogs, and they did eat them, although they were sort of luke warm in the process.  They did not bolt them down like they do with milkbone.  We only had the one box and I did not notice any difference in the way their teeth looked or their ""dog breath.""<br /><br />Because it is a vine product, I do not know if the price of the item is fair. I think I will just stick with Milkbone products."
77396,B003BQCIRS,4.0,"I loved the chips they were great. They arrived on time in the mail, there were no crushed chips yay!"
80139,B003SHIH5W,4.0,"Initially I did not like the color, but once I kneaded it, it was fine.  Good flavor.  Item was shipped as expected."
129252,B000ONACVK,1.0,I weighed the bag when I got it and it was shy of a pound. I didn't like the bag it came in. I will not buy from this company again.
82663,B000U0MTMW,4.0,This honey is really good and dissolves well in hot drinks and food. And its a nice economical size. Makes a great and more nutritious substitute for sugar. Much better for you than artificial sweetners.
127696,B001BOVE54,1.0,"First, I applaud Wellness for coming up with a grain free formula because I think cats are probably better off not eating any grains.  Also I give credit that they left out the menadione.  Unfortunately though, Core kibble proved to be a bomb in my household.  My cats HATE IT with a purple passion.  Also there has been a dramatic increase in barfing episodes ever since I introduced it (and yes I did introduce it gradually).  I could have put up with the very strong and unpleasant odor it fills my house with if the cats had loved it but given the negatives I am going back to my old kibble - Pet Promise.  Mendadione and all."
123751,B000NWYKG0,1.0,"Every single can of Jyoti Natural Foods Delhi Saag, Spinach and Mustard Greens was dented. At first I thought it was just because they were poorly packed, but I realize that Amazon sent me a box of pre-dented cans, since the interior box was not sealed as most bulk orders from Jyoti are, and other items in my shipment were not damaged. Amazon, this is the way you lose customers!"
82545,B000FL52IY,4.0,"The first time I ordered coffee, it was fresh and sealed tight. Second order the coffee wasn't as fresh. Good price though for bulk"
252038,B001BU0JEK,2.0,This product shipped quickly but I was disappointed with the product itself...very little candy in each box.
125135,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"It's really too bad there isn't an option to give 0 stars, or even better in a case like this, negative stars.  I almost never do reviews on products, but I, like so many loyal and long term addicts of the 70% bar am shocked at what Lindt has done.  The new recipe is basically the same thing as those terrible Ghirardelli squares of waxy tasteless ""chocolate"".  The original 70% was amazing.  It had a great texture, just enough sweet to balance things out, and there was no mistaking the cocoa.  It was also always a bit of a surprise every time I would eat it.  Sometimes it had hints of citrus, sometimes it was a bit nutty.  Maybe that was the vanilla, but whatever it was, there is nothing about the new recipe that even comes close to anything I used to enjoy about the 70% bar.  Now I have to try and find a replacement for what used to be the perfect chocolate experience.  Thanks for nothing Lindt."
246513,B002D4DY8G,2.0,"Gevalia is known as a great coffee, but I was a little disappointed with this particular blend/flavor. With a name like ""dark chocolate truffle"" I would expect to taste chocolate, but I didn't. There is a smell of chocolate in the air when it is being made, but not enough actually in the coffee when drinking it. I guess I am a chocolate snob because I want something that says 'chocolate' to actally taste like chocolate, but this particulalr coffee just did not do it for me."
240636,B001GQ3E4G,2.0,"I bought this at the supermarket since it's more natural than some of the other mainstream brands expecting for it to be tastier, but apparently I like the major brand's creamy smooth peanut butter better.<br /><br />I thought it was personally TOO sweet, and it wasn't smooth and creamy because of all the crunchy little granules of what I can assume is salt since the ingredients did not list sugar.  I do not like those crunches/shatterings of the granules in what is suppose to be a smooth peanut butter - it just messes with my expectations.  Too bad because now I have an almost full jar of uneaten peanut butter"
17659,B001EPPGXG,5.0,"A little education in Ayurveda - In Ayurvedic principles, the Kapha 'element' is said to be similar to clay (elements of water and earth). It helps to hold our constitution together and provides structure, fluid balance, endurance and strength. It is the slow, stable, calming, sweet and cold aspect of the self and governs our resistance to disease and promotes self healing.<br /><br />An imbalance in kapha leads to respiratory illnesses, excess cough/cold symptoms, weight gain, general feeling of laziness/heaviness.<br /><br />Kapha tea is an excellent antidote to a kapha imbalance - the tea itself is spicy and invigorating with strong notes of cardamom, ginger followed by cinnamon and lemon verbena.  It's spicy, complex and my new favorite!  I ordered a bodum tea press so I can brew this tea at work."
16571,B000RJARJS,5.0,"If you like black tea, this is it. No flavors added, no smokiness as you can find in Russian black teas."
82466,B003VIJI1A,4.0,"This is the only soy-free brand of soup I've been able to find, and I'm thrilled to have it for casseroles and other recipes. I'm unable to give it 5 stars, however, because of the strong garlic flavor. I LOVE garlic, but it's not always a welcome addition to my recipes, like chicken casserole (this is true of their Cream of Chicken soup, too). Still, I can live with the garlic taste if it means avoiding an allergic reaction!"
256010,B0049UH8A2,2.0,"These are alright, but they have a really fake taste to them. I bought the YummyEarth Organic Lollipops around the same time, and the lollipops hands down beat this candy and they are not that much more in carbs and sugar. I guess the lollipops ruined my experience with these. lol"
17285,B000EVIDUY,5.0,I was so surprised how wonderful these brownies taste. They are definitely superior to the standard wheat version. I also cut and freeze them and they are still great. It is nice to know gluten-free can beat mainstream mixes on taste.
16447,B007TJGZ54,5.0,"I recently purchased the 50 count Green Mountain Breakfast Blend and I have to say that the price was unbeatable, Not to mention the coffee. I only drink Green Mountain Coffee. I only wish they could offer more variety in the 50 count. I will and am going to continue buying this brand of coffee.Love it- Love it- Love it<br /><br />  Thank You Green Mountain Coffee"
134509,B003E728CE,1.0,"It looks as if the previous reviews are all for Pill Pockets in general, which are a great product for dogs.  This flavor variety, though, is horrible, judging by the packet I was sent.<br /><br />I opened the package, and they smelled exactly like (forgive the imagery) diarrhea.  And strongly.  I thought someone had had an accident until I realized where it was coming from.<br /><br />I thought maybe it was a flavor dogs like. You never know.  Some cheese smells bad too.  My poor dog spit it out and gagged when I fed it to him.<br /><br />This is either a very misguided flavor attempt, or the completely sealed package somehow went rotten (not a good sign), or they filled it with rotten product at the packaging stage (also not reassuring).<br /><br />Sickening, horrible, unfit to be put in the trash.  Had to flush it."
254143,B001EQ5JLY,2.0,"I purchased PG Tips Black tea based on the raving reviews.  I new it was basic simple but popular tea and that's what I expected.  But what I got was not tea at all, it's some kind of tea dust nicely packed in attractive pyramid bag.  It's below the lowest quality of any tea I ever tried."
248105,B002NHYQQC,2.0,"Before anyone buys this they should realize it's 34% cocoa.<br /><br />This means the rest of the bar is basically cocoa butter. It tastes like it, too. If you're a big chocolate lover, 34% does not taste very chocolatey, and the consistency coupled with the taste is sort of gross.<br /><br />I would suggest at least 45% cocoa. Up to 55% is great, too. After that you'll get the more bitter dark chocolate flavor, which I also find delicious in it's own way."
128804,B0032GREWQ,1.0,I am in my fifties and grew up on Potato Buds. My mom was an excellent cook but in a pinch she used the (ORIGINAL) BC Potatoe Buds and boy were they good!  I bought a box recently thinking they were the same.  Not!!!!  These were a gummy mess!  I had to add a lot of extras just to make them palatable.  Do not buy!  Switch to Idahoan for good instant potatoes!
81034,B001E0QE1Y,4.0,"These crackers are quite unique.  Interesting that they are called ""Fruit and Seed Crunch,"" because the only fruit in the product is 14% currants, which adds a bit of a tang to the taste, nothing else.  As a Vegan treat, these are quite satisfying.  I smear some peanut butter on two; and that's breakfast.<br /><br />Imported from Great Britain, these crackers are made with whole grain rye and wheat flour and then lightly dusted with pumpkin and sunflower seeds.  Honestly, one of these things is quite filling.  The fiber content is good, too.<br /><br />As part of a healthy diet plan, these crackers are excellent.  Substitute these for bread and see how you like it!"
80518,B008ADQYYU,4.0,"I don't think I'd be a girl if I didn't love chocolate.  I don't think anything could be better than matching raspberry with chocolate.  My sister-in-law buys these chocolate covered raspberries (in bulk!!!) and so I ordered this matcha hoping that it would satisfy me enough so I wouldn't steal her stash and become 400 pounds!  I opened this matcha and was pleasantly surprised to smell chocolate!  I couldn't seem to smell the raspberry in it.  I put it into a tin to keep it fresh, if it'll make it very long.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I really wasn't sure how I wanted to prepare this matcha.  First I prepared it with just 1 tsp matcha and 16.9oz of water.  It was ok, but not really what I was looking for.  I seemed to get more chocolate from it this way and not enough raspberry flavor.  SO, next I heated up some milk, added a bit of sugar and frothed it up into a latte.  Now here is where I get more of the raspberry.  It's a nice creamy truffle.<br />On a side note, I'll be learning to make truffles from tea as a local tea shop this week so maybe I'll be able to use what I have left in making a tea truffle!  You can never go wrong with chocolate and raspberries that don't make you gain weight.<br />THANKS again Red Leaf for another wonderful matcha creation....keep'em comin'!<br />To get your own tasty Raspberry Truffle Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]"
129404,B008EG4Y9K,1.0,"I bought the box because it looked good and the sugar and fiber content.  However, my first thought on tasting it was that the box would have tasted better.  I found the taste bland and they did smell like cardboard.  They never softened up to look like the ones on the back of the box."
17245,B005DM3N2M,5.0,"I love Crystal Light. It has helped me to shed 45 pounds over an 11 month period, as the taste is so good I stopped drinking Sodas and sweet drinks as I had done for so long. And the price was very affordable to boot."
156044,B000TQBEFK,3.0,"This is a very good sugar-free syrup but I can't say that it tastes much like honey, though it is thicker than ordinary pancake syrup. If you want more honey flavor you will have to mix in a little real honey and make it a low-sugar honey. Overall, it's pretty good."
242508,B005FUOROA,2.0,"I was not too enamored of this bar. The white chocolate with lemon zest flavor was delectable, but the peppercorns 'crashed the party'. They ruin the taste in my opinion. Ginger would have been a much better choice than peppercorns."
133495,B0043DUZ3C,1.0,"These pistachio nuts are terrible. They made me so sick that I threw away most of them.<br />I suffered from violent stomach pains after eating them!<br />I thought that perhaps it was a bad bag so after three days of pain finally stopped, I was stupid enough to open a second of the bags thinking it was just the one bag that was bad. Wrong. After eating a dozen nuts the stomach pains returned, just as painful.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THESE NUTS if you don't want to suffer from pains. I didn't seek to return them and get my money back because it was a food product.<br /><br />I have bought pistachios many times from Amazon, but I always bought Keenan Farms In Shell pistachios in Plastic Jars but Amazon was out of stock on these so I thought I would try these in the bag pistachios.<br /><br />How can the same farm produce pistachios so different from each other? Were this whole crop contaminated? Even the feel of the nuts were different between the two. Those in the plastic jars were ""softer"" while those in the bags were hard and hurt my teeth and gums to chew.<br /><br />Strange, to say the least."
17550,B000UVZ3ZG,5.0,"My husband and I are diabetic and we search for sugar free/no sugar added goods and beverages.  My husband loves iced coffee, but it is hard because those you can buy in the store or at retail establishments include sugar.  This is delicious.  We make it with fat free milk, add decaf coffee, the mix, and ice.  You should try it."
136769,B000CQ01NS,1.0,I am going to take the advise of the first reviewer and add a bunch of stuff. I guess I was hoping this would taste like Kraft Mac and Cheese and no go. My kids like it and that is what matters most I guess. We just went gluten free and so I maybe over time we will get used to it. We are also eating rice sticks that are sold mostly to chinese restaurants and those are GREAT! Made with just rice and water-you can use them for just about anything.I guess that will be more to my taste. Good luck on this item-not for me-kids would say it is pretty good though.
151342,B000EA0D26,3.0,well....let me state first that we like this natural sugar.  that said...when we received it...it must have come in contact with dampness either from the manufacturer or via shipping....each bag of sugar was hard.  we had to bang it on the counter many times to break it up.  have had it once before and it was fine.  wasn't hard or lumpy but still smelled weird!<br /><br />now for the unpleasant part....it does not smell like regular processed white sugar from supermarkets.  it has an odor of cat pee.  which i thought very peculiar.  although...when you use it to cook with or put it in tea..coffee...cereal...this odor disappears completely.  i guess it's the nature of the unrefined processing????<br /><br />it's actually stronger than 'white' sugar!  you don't need as much!  and we will buy it again.  just don't have a sensitive nose or keep your nose out of the sugar jar!  and you'll be just fine!
243519,B00305L330,2.0,I haven't tried it yet.. but so far not pleased with the idea that it's half empty looking.. Especially for the price. Haven't tried it yet since miraculously the day it's delivered we have no milk..
161723,B000K6Z22U,3.0,I always wanted to try different salts but this one was not for me...too crunchy
134783,B000EITYUU,1.0,This bag of salt came in a box from amazon.  When it arrived I opened the box and it was full of salt.  The bag had a slit in the side.  I will never use a product like that.  I contacted the company and they were no help. They told me to contact amazon.  I had been on vacation and it was passed the time limit to return the product to amazon.  I think it was very poor customer service from the company not to replace the bag for me.  I am a brand new customer with this product and was excited to find celtic sea salt because i had read it was good for your health.  I am a  business owner and i know to keep a new customer I would have gone out of my way to make them happy so they would remain a customer.  I will not order from this company again.  Customer Service is very important to me and this company dropped the ball.
17306,B000EVIDUY,5.0,This mix is very good and you cant beat it warm with ice cream!<br /><br />These were very tasty and enjoyed by ALL!
80056,B001HTG4TO,4.0,"This is an excellent gluten free alternative to oatmeal.  The taste is really not like any other hot cereal, the buckwheat isn't dominant but compliments the corn.  Sort of like a variant of grits, but I like it with maple syrup, cinnamon and apple chunks."
254132,B003GTAESU,2.0,"The cookies come in a timely manner and are packaged very well.  I send to my Grandmother who loves them.  As you know, they are not stocking in grocery stores anymore (only gas stations and vending like this product is intended for).  It costs $20 something for 24 cookies ordering this way.  I understand making profit, but the suppliers price is less that $44 per 72 count.  Usually about $32/72.  I know this is a place to make a profit and I commend them for doing so...but this is a very high margin.<br /><br />Other than the price, the cookies are great.  Grandma has gained 13 very needed pounds."
82589,B001D3PXZ0,4.0,Only issues is that some packages seem to get old? Not as fresh as store bought; although sometimes store bought can have the same feeling.  Hit and miss.  Don't get me wrong most are good but a few pack seem to have gotten old.
153714,B000HDMW8S,3.0,"Reasonably tasty, kind of ugly in the can, no comparison with the King Oscar Brisling crosspack in olive oil (which is much more expensive)."
123500,B004XLU98A,1.0,"The antler was too soft. I had to take it away from my German Shepherd after a couple of days. I was amazed how quickly it disappeared. I bought it in a local pet store where it sold for a lot more money.<br /><br />I had bought a different brand previously, which I can't remember, and it lasted for over a year."
249884,B000FSPQTM,2.0,"Shipping is terrible. I've paid for 24 cans of this chew to arrive in two days(due friday) and it arrives the following week monday! But on top of that, it seems that there are a few cans that have less than others. Not worth the money."
234097,B001EO6E0Q,2.0,"I could discern little taste difference after mixing this with Vinegar and Olive oil as specified on the package. It's ok, but nothing really stands out with the flavoring.  Is it the ""natural"" angle they were going for here?  I'm not sure.  Maybe this might work better as a marinade mixture, but as for going to the trouble of mixing this with regular Vinegar & Olive oil, why bother?"
82458,B001945N2G,4.0,"Perhaps it's because I live in northern Canada (although that shouldn't be an excuse), but it took a few days for the product to be shipped.  Once, however, it was, it arrive on the last day of the projected delivery day.<br /><br />No complaints."
76937,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"This is a tasty snack that seems to fit the ""natural"" category,  in that it has no artificial flavors or preservatives, hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup.  The oats combined with the dark chocolate is good, but it's dry and needs a glass of milk to go with it."
247922,B004T3QMD8,2.0,"This product was not very flavorful.  Kept having to add teaspoons of it to try and get it to taste right...waaaay beyond the directions amount listed on the can.  And by the time you got enough flavor, the aftertaste was very bitter.  There was a good amount of creamy foam on top, but this just didn't make up for the lack of taste."
77146,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"When I first looked in the package, I wasn't sure if there was enough chocolate.  But, after trying it, I really liked it.  There is a good balance between the granola and the chocolate and it tastes really good.  (I have a strong sweet tooth though, so for some it may be too sweet.)  I literally sat and ate it out of the bag.  That is how I discovered the negative about it.  It's pretty crumbly and in very small pieces.  It can be messy eating it as a snack then."
133919,B001E5DZUC,1.0,It is definitely stale and burned. All three bags. Unless you think that French Roast is supposed to taste like charcoal.<br />Chuck Full Of Nuts would be the closest comparable brand.
124610,B000PEEBYC,1.0,The bag I got did not look like the bag pictured. The food was stale and my dog got sick. Will not be buying dog food from here again.
126987,B000ZGO8Z2,1.0,"Bitter and not what I thought it was going to taste like. Wish I had not bought 2 of them. I'll try it on a baked ham, but never on any bread."
123934,B001FA1D0U,1.0,I ordered different Toblerone Chocolates in large quantities and amazon shipped me most with like a 4-5 months expiry dates. If I had known then I would have ordered limited quantities.
16568,B000RJARJS,5.0,"When we visited Turkey last Xmas, we drank straight or honey-sweetened Turkish tea along with delicious baklava several times a day to make up for the cold. My boys fell in love with Turkish tea there. Back home, we tried to find some good Turkish tea. I ordered several kinds. After doing thorough testing (!!) we decided that this was the best tea among the 4 kinds we sampled!<br /><br />The taste: very clean and pure. A light, well pitched, fragrant component. A hint of sweetness in the background.<br /><br />We brew it in a cast iron Japanese tea kettle, pour boiling water in it, then dilute it in the glass or mug to the concentration we want. Purists beware: we often sweeten it with honey, and I typically add a drop of lemon:-)"
82479,B001C4PK4Y,4.0,I bought this due to my dog seeming to have a food allergy to corn and grains. He eats it and seems to enjoy it so time will tell if this solves his skin problems.
77855,B001LG940E,4.0,"I really enjoyed this flavor of Switch, as well. It's startling when you first take a sip, because although it's advertised as sparkling juice, I for one still expect an overly-sweet soda taste. What you find instead is simply a carbonated fruit juice. The taste is true to the natural juice flavor, refreshing with the right amount of carbonation. This one had a very slightly funny, maybe slightly bitter aftertaste, so I gave it 4.5 stars. Overall, tasty, healthy and refreshing!"
124866,B005BHIESC,1.0,"I love Vita Coco Coconut Water.  But I made a big mistake ordering a case of the Tropical Fruit flavor.  The other flavors are fantastic and I would highly recommend them, but the Tropical Fruit simply doesn't taste good and leaves a strange aftertaste......."
243169,B004CSJU8E,2.0,I bought these for my daughter as a starter food.  She loved it for the first thirty seconds before she broke off a piece and started choking on it.  I would not recomend this for children until they are fully on solid foods.
245830,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"Of the 34 K-Cups, there was only 10 varieties.  We received about 6 of the same French Vanilla and Hazelnut.  Just like everyone said, order just thrown in a box."
76072,B002EAQXQO,4.0,"These vanilla chip bars are very tasty and I would order them again. But. They are high sugar and, therefore, high calorie for a pretty small bar. Best for a small, sweet treat, not for a filling or ""stick with you"" kind of energy."
149664,B000E8WIAS,3.0,"I love the Sweet Leaf stevia, but the Vanilla Creme isn't one of my favorites. It's an odd flavor and doesn't taste very vanilla-y to me. If you are new to Sweet Leaf, I recommend trying a different flavor: my favorites are Rootbeer, English Toffee, and Cinnamon."
16540,B002HNZRKQ,5.0,"My household was going through 2 - 3 regular 5 oz bottles per month since discovering the best pepper sauce ever and were delighted to find this one gallon jug.  Even with the coupons I got in the paper and online this is a major money saver!  With a small funnel is easy to pour into the small Tabasco bottle.  We eat it on nearly anything and everything...latino foods, burgers, pizza, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, fried, pickled), grilled cheese sandwiches, baked or grilled chicken, wings, steak, pork chops, and so on.<br /><br />Just like another reviewer I had never really been a huge fan on Tabasco.  My husband regularly used the original, and I liked the milder green on latino foods, but then I tried the new chipotle flavor and want to put it on everything.  It is SO YUMMY.  My mouth is watering just writing this review.  Mmmmm...<br /><br />P.S.  I ordered mine from Tabasco's website vs. Amazon.  The shipping was $5 cheaper on their site, plus I found a $5 off promo code online :)"
249388,B004TPKAN4,2.0,The ginger taste in these cookies is just about right but I would have preferred a cookie a bit less hard/crispy. These are a bit too difficult to eat in that respect for my liking although I guess that's why the call 'em 'snaps'.
80396,B0009XPD64,4.0,"Used to buy this from Petco, easier and less expensive on line.  Last time they shipped me the wrong flavor (and cost themselves $20.00 in return shipping).  That's the only issue I've had.  The food itself is an excellent premium brand, dog loves it, coat looks great and it has never upset his stomach (used to feed ""chicken soup for the dog lover's soul and it did)"
249035,B002NGKHJ8,2.0,"I received this product and immediately noticed that the grading is off. The product I received seems to be a broken orange pekoe grade. It does not resemble the picture AT ALL (which does represent a TGFOP grade). All in all, I have found the tea to be pleasant tasting, not overly tannic, plenty of body. But I ordered and paid for a higher grade of tea. It's not acceptable to furnish an inferior grade of tea."
249746,B001LGGH54,2.0,"I appreciate the more ""natural"" angle of this soft drink compared to more staple carbonated drinks, but this was too crazy sweet for my taste buds. I don't know if the formula changed but I'd had one of these in the glass bottle from the store before and this one felt like a completely different animal.<br /><br />I guess if you like Crush drinks and the like, this may be up your alley though."
255566,B000634CJQ,2.0,"The add originally posted did not have the weight of the dog food in the add.  In fact, under product review, it claims its weight is 41#s.  When I received the package of only 8#s, I was disappointed with the size vs the cost.  I am a new amazon food consumer.  I will continue to order but will be more wary of quantity vs cost especially with these types of items.  The product is great and I did receive it in a timely manner, aside from a delay due to weather storm in the Southeastern Mountains."
79149,B000Y041JW,4.0,"The Savu Smoker Bags (hickory) are best for grilling meat, especially pork chops. Fish is overwhelmed (imho) by the hickory taste, especially salmon. The bags do what they're intended to do, and make the grilling process extremely simple."
77769,B001LG940E,4.0,"I was skeptical before trying this, as I'm not a huge fan of most sodas.  I was very pleasantly surprised, and definitley enjoyed this.  The amount of carbonation was perfect, and the taste was sweet, but not too sweet.  My kids tried it and liked it too, and although they don't regularly drink soda, I would let them have this now and then as a treat.  I'm impressed with the ingredient list as well, and if you are going to drink a sweet carbonated drink, this one would be a better choice than many others.  It reminded me a bit of the soda my mom used to buy at the ""Pop Shop"" as a kid.  No aftertaste, either.  Worth a try!"
17576,B0000GH6UQ,5.0,"When it came to hot chocolate my beverage used to be swiss miss.  But after one cold morning of moving a hot tub I was rewarded with Abuelita.  This hot cocoa has tastes of cinnamon and other spices.  I like to add a bit of cayenne or chili powder to it, and it is just delicious."
82416,B0007IQQXA,4.0,"I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla.  It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either.  It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste.  I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice."
17083,B003CH4Q5I,5.0,"I was looking for a ketchup that had very low sugar content and thought a little spice would be an added bonus. So this product fit the bill perfectly. I agree with the very accurate description of the ketchup by the previous reviewer. Just that little bit of kick and the thicker texture make it amazingly versatile. I don't eat much beef, but I have tried it on a burger and it was great. But my absolute favorite use is on fish--particularly the meatier types of fish, like tuna, that can get a bit dry if grilled.It has also replaced barbecue sauce for me on pork chops. I love this stuff. What a find!"
123640,B003DA54HS,1.0,"I bought this product today hoping to amuse my chew-loving dog. But after unwrapping the packaging, I was disappointed. Not only did the bone have a weird, unnatural oil all over it but it also smelled like chemicals. I offered it to my dog, who after being so excited at the sight of the bone, smelled it and walked away! I tried to wash off all the meat and other particles outside but even the inside smelled like chemicals and my dog was not buying it!"
79968,B000B5HRNM,4.0,I have such a hard time finding this stuff and I love it! So glad I could find it but the shipping was a little pricey.
18004,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"This is the most wonderful thing for those of us who LOVE peanut butter, but are also watching our waistlines.  I think this tastes every bit as good as other peanut butters that are so much higher in fat and calories.  I'd recommend it to anyone!"
16554,B0000Y3PBM,5.0,"This is by far the best coffee I've ever had. If you don't want to be addicted to a particular brand/flavor, then do not try this. Otherwise, you will be hooked. I have also tried their cinnamon blend, which I did not care for as much (seemed to be too strong of a cinnamon flavor, and I love cinnamon). Check out prices at their website first though, as they may be cheaper there."
131689,B002V5D3YM,1.0,"Interesting, I place my order, my order is accepted, I receive notification that the item has been back ordered because it's out of stock, I tell them I'm willing to wait, I then receive notice that my order was canceled, and then I'm asked to write this review.<br /><br />Mallomars are great, I've ordered in the past when this supplier had them in stock and delivery was quick and great. Just watch when they tell you it's out of stock."
17114,B0018CE5L4,5.0,I had been using this cat food for several months.  I had rescued a cat looking awfully skinny and dehydrated and as she began to fatten a little she quickly showed signs of pregnancy.  She gave birth a few weeks late to 6 kittens and I still have them all.  They have been fed nothing but Diamond once weaned and have beautiful coats and are very healthy and bouncy.  So thankful for Diamond.
79211,B003TNANSO,4.0,"These are excellent.  They keep well, don't tend to be too messy, and taste great.  Only 4 stars because it's a bit misleading to call it peanut butter anything, considering there is no peanut butter in them at all.  Other than that, I like them and will keep ordering."
137602,B0018CFQLC,1.0,"My sort-of feral cat that I've been feeding actually spit the stuff out and I know he likes rabbits. The dog doesn't even like it and he's always dipping into the cat food. There was a recall for sorguhm on this lot so maybe that affected the taste? Can't seem to get dog or cat to accept any of these wholesome products without grain and it does get to be an expensive experiment but spitting out was a first.<br />Also, the color of the product is black? Is that right? It looked burnt."
78473,B006R098DW,4.0,"This was bought as part of a gag gift, but all of them got eaten (by adults. Everyone liked the flavor."
150972,B000HDKZJG,3.0,"Your satisfaction with this product will depend on how you eat it. This is not the kind of cereal you pour into a bowl, add milk and eat immediately. Unfortunately, the cereal is very hard; I would not call it crunchy, it's just plain hard.<br /><br />There are two ways around this. I customarily pour this cereal on top of plain yogurt, add milk and let it sit in the fridge overnight. By morning, the cereal is soft but not soggy. Of course it's not crunchy/crispy either but when you eat gluten-free you tolerate a lot. Alternatively, you can add milk or water to the cereal and heat it in the microwave. It's actually good this way, like a form of oatmeal.<br /><br />I don't mind the flavor, but again, I've been eating gluten-free for 3 years and know not to expect too much. I do like the fact that a serving provides 5 grams of fiber (more challenging to get on a gluten-free diet) and is fortified with vitamins and minerals."
75720,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"Have been getting this for a while and when local stores had trouble getting it, I turned to Amazon.<br />With Prime shipping, this is a great deal and an awesome product.<br />The only issue I have occasionally, is if this is incorrectly packaged at the warehouse, it will arrive damaged.<br />It ships in a 12 can case, but the warehouse has a habit of packing on its side which can result in damage.<br />To date 30% of my shipments have arrived damaged BUT, customer service has been awesome resolving issues!!!  My hat is off to those folks!!!"
247376,B001EO6DBG,2.0,"This was my second to least favorite of the balsamic creams I tried.<br />I first encountered Balsamic Cream in England a few years ago. When I was in Italy March 2008, I bought Mazzetti Balsamico Cremoso at a grocery store, which was wonderful and reasonably priced. Earlier this year I bought a couple varieties on Amazon, and I just bought a few more for holiday gifts, not all of which are making the cut! Here are my personal views of the ones I bought:<br /><br />#1 Casa Rinaldi Crema di Balsamico Blanco (white). This is not the dark Balsamic Cream I have had before, but of all the ones I've now tasted, this is my favorite. It is the perfect balance of vinegar and sweet, the texture is thick, but the flavor is light. Wonderful! ($11.95 for 8 oz from [...])<br /><br />#2 De Negris Balsamico Glaze - also a great flavor, balancing vinegar and sweet, but much thinner texture. Fine for dipping bread etc. ($11/7.3 oz) ($10/13.5 oz on Amazon)<br /><br />#3Da Magreta Acetaia Real Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modena (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena): second best flavor and thicker ($23/16.9 oz)<br /><br />#4 Modenaceti Balsamic Gkaze: thicker, good flavor, but more grapey than the others above. (3x13.5oz for $28)<br /><br />I also tasted Earthy Delights, which was thick and more tangy/vinegary than the others above. I'll use what I have, but probably not buy more. $14.50/500ml<br /><br />For my taste I would not again purchase Mussini Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modeno (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - sweet, grapey, caramel-y"" and don't know what to do with Roland Balsamic Glaze (thick, but very, very vinegary - ugh)."
136457,B006Q820X0,1.0,"I received this last week and was surprised that there were coffee grounds all over the amazon box.  I thought it might be one of the kcups inside had broken and that was the case but it appeared that none of the kcups inside were damaged.  That being said the outside packaging looked promising, great design.  Overall I have been underwhelmed by the quality of the coffee.  It tastes old and weak.  Plus the Kcups look like they were hand done and don't have the uniformity I would expect from a professional Kcup manufacturer. I've ordered multiple different brews from the Brooklyn Bean Roastery so I'm hoping some of the next versions will be done with higher quality.  While it isn't my favorite coffee by any means it is drinkable and I'm going to try different size cups to see if I can get it to be a bit more bold and rich.<br /><br />-----UPDATE:<br />So I finally received the rest of my order Fuhgeddaboudit and Cyclone.  All of these have been less than average.  The kcup packaging is flawed in each case I received.  I also dislike all of the different coffee styles.  Each one tastes like the grounds are dry and stale.  Although I'd like to blame quality control I really think the coffee itself is just bad. Either way I will definitely not be buying coffee from this company again and I would warn everyone reading these reviews to stay away as well.  All their 5 star reviews are from people that don't have verified orders.<br /><br />I wasted my money... don't waste yours."
128877,B003VIWRCM,1.0,I never thought it was possible that my cats would turn away from wet food but they will not eat this stuff.  We've been feeding them Purina wet food and they absolutely LOVE it.  I took a chance with this Instinct food and now I'm stuck with 23 cans.
17824,B000EA3PEY,5.0,"All natural and taste delicious. Great snack food or add to a dish.Taste great in wild rice, salads, yogurt."
76786,B0049ULB78,4.0,"it's the best if you like dark and bold. my wife thinks it smells foul but i like dark coffee, chocolate, and beer. this is a rich coffee experience.<br />the only caveat is all K cups are, in my estimation, overpriced. AND they are not recyclable."
150621,B000TFSKLM,3.0,"If you just really have to have an ESE machine and want good espresso you can't go wrong will illy.  But if you don't care about having a true espresso machine with a yucky portafilter that you have to keep clean then you should just go for the iPerespresso pods and machine instead.  I have compared these literally side-by-side and the complexity, intensity, and body of the iPerespresso shot just totally blows away the ESE shot, not to mention there is ZERO cleanup, but you are stuck with the pier pods, but who cares.  for 10 cents more a cup you get a truly perfect shot every single time of great illy espresso."
80450,B001BOTB72,4.0,If it were up to my cat this would get 10 stars.  He is 15 years old and has decided he doesn't want kibble anymore and this is the only soft food he likes (Wellness Healthy Indulgence Grain Free pouches).  When I have tried other soft food he loses weight because he refuses to finish it or to eat it at all.  I guess he knows what food is the healthiest!<br /><br />I gave this only 4 stars because of the price.
81836,B005CUU25G,4.0,"So, my dog likes it. I'll just get that out there right away.<br />But, it's awkward to carry and can be messy (which I didn't think it would be) but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out, sometimes it just decides ""Oh you want ALL of it!"" and I have a sticky snouted puppy.<br />And, she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better."
79492,B003TNANSO,4.0,The KIND Plus cranberry almond bars are healthy for you and absolutely delicious.  I think they are better if you refrigerate them prior to consuming.  Great product.
164935,B003R0LLXK,3.0,"I always order Purina Pro Plan cat food from Amazon, as with Amazon Prime I receive prompt two day service with no shipping cost.  I am handicapped and cannot get out to shop and this is a tremendous asset to me!!<br />HOWEVER, this order was shipped incorrectly....instead of one ""Salmon"" and 1 ""Chicken"", I received two bags of ""Chicken with Rice"". As it is too difficult for me to return one, can you send 1 ""Salmon"" at N/C or a reduced rate to compensate for the inconvenience"
82699,B005UP1M4I,4.0,The Ne-Cap capsule doesn't work very well the way the company intended.  The adhesive discs don't stick and the 5 pre-punched holes are too small.  However the plastic capsule even though it is smaller than the Nespresso capsule works great if sealed with regular aluminum foil and the 5 holes in the bottom are opened up a bit.  I've refilled the capsules 8 or 10 times and they work very well.  The original box of 100 will last a long time which makes for a very expensive coffee.
161500,B000EZUAEW,3.0,"The cookies are good but not so good when they are melted into one ""giant cookie"".  For the price I paid for shipping this product, I expected better.  The cookies should be in packaging so they are not subject to temperature extremes or they should not ship these in the summer!"
157688,B000EVNYRG,3.0,"These crackers are definitely a healthy snack, but they don't taste exactly like what you think of when you think about a graham cracker.  They are softer and don't have that crisp snap to them.  They are small.  They do help fill-up your sweet tooth, which is what I got them for.  They have a little sweetness to them, but aren't sugary.  They are OK overall--a good snack for young children."
17127,B008FSIHNG,5.0,"These fabulous little red pearls are even better than Craisins!  Plump, juicy and perfect in banana bread.  The semi-tart cherry flavor has body and a definitive taste.  Will buy these again and again. Great surprise."
131129,B000KSVLF0,1.0,"This coffee was very stale, it had no expiration or product date.<br />The coffee had no body, no aroma,very harsh tasting.<br />The company refused to replace it or give a refund.<br />We had this same coffee once before and it was very<br />good. Just must have been a bad batch or old."
150748,B004B9UKE2,3.0,"I love Demetris regular and extra horseradsih, but the Chipotle is really hot. I like hot food, wings etc but this was just too hot alone.  Now I use the extra horseradish mix and put a dash of this in too kick it up. But be warned, this is really hot"

17286,B000EVIDUY,5.0,"The Gluten-Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix is so easy to make and tastes heavenly.  I combined two packages and baked the brownies in a large cake pan, then cut them into serving size and froze them.  They taste as good after being frozen as they did the day I baked them.  In my book, these brownies taste better than anything sold in the supermarkets as regular wheat-containing brownies.  I recommend the mix to anyone hungry for the real thing!"
17300,B000EVIDUY,5.0,"Wonderfully tasty brownies for those of us who can't have glutens in our diet.  These are so good, very moist, great taste and I can't tell them from the regular brownies I use to make from scratch.  I add about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts sometimes to the mix and so far not one person that I have shared these with can tell any difference from regular brownies.  One friend actually ask me for my recipe and when I told her what they were she didn't believe that they were gluten free.  Will be back to buy more of these for sure."
155523,B000FFLHU2,3.0,This is something I've wanted to try.  It's OK but not a favorite.  Can't compare to other brands as I have only tried this one.
125038,B00474QXQA,1.0,WAY too expensive for the quality - NO RETURNS -- Not a good purchase -- I am a big amazon fan and use it regularly - typically the reviews do not lead me astray - this one did :(
130689,B000NY3A8C,1.0,"There are 85 servings in this 3oz container. Each serving is only 1/4 teaspoon and yet each serving is a WHOPPING 240 mg. of sodium. Not only that but the 2nd ingredient is Monosodium Glutamate....I could be wrong but I believe this is a form or MSG.<br />Regardless, I am very disappointed in the taste of the product...hard to describe but think ""wheat"" plus salt flavors and that comes close to describing this seasoning...... in addition to not liking the taste I am really surprised by how high the sodium is..... and suspicious that it is loaded w/MSG.<br />I do not recommend this and am very sorry I bought it. Will probably just toss. One of the very few utter disappointments I've gotten on Amazon.<br />I was searching Amazon for ""dried mint"" when this came up. Yes, I read the other two reviews and did not see a mention of mint.... it was late at night, I was tired.... blah, blah.... just so you know there is absolutely zero mint in this seasoning and I'm wondering why it showed up in my original search.... oh well, live and learn."
156045,B000TQBEFK,3.0,Unlike many of Nature's Hollow's other great tasting products this one didn't my expectations. The flavor is very mild or weak compared to real honey. Most of the other products that Nature's Hallow puts out taste just as good or better then the regular product with sugar.
128699,B000H0ZJNG,1.0,I've purchased this product at pet stores before and the filets are moist and have a nice texture. I recently opened my filets and they were dry and stale even though the expiration date states April 2013. I recommend you purchase at a local store so you can return if you have a similar issue.
240632,B001GQ3E4G,2.0,"It bothers me that if you search Amazon for Organic Peanut Butter, this shows up at the top of the search results. It is NOT organic. Why do I care? Because peanuts can be a very high pesticide and carcinogenic-laced product; and I eat it every day.<br />I convinced myself that because the product page says ""certified kosher, vegan, and is even gluten-free"" that it was just an oversight that they didn't include the organic term in the description since it showed up so high in my search results. I bought a 6-pack, and thankfully Amazon refunded my purchase, but it doesn't change the fact that this is still showing up in the 'organic' search results.<br />I realize it's my own fault...but I still feel a bit duped and hoping to help anyone else looking for organic peanut butter."
17905,B001EO653M,5.0,This is a fabulous drink that our entire family enjoys ! It has just the right combination of spices and chocolate.
153249,B002863BIW,3.0,It is a nice product with an easy to use sprinkler. I like the cheesy flavour and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking at introducing a cheesy flavour to their meals without the added calories from real cheese. So far i have added it to pasta and its delish!
17662,B00009OLEW,5.0,You can buy this at the pet store for about 2.19 a can . on the web here this is a rip. Sorry
17360,B000EVIDUY,5.0,Everyone who has tried these say they are to die for.  Best brownies they ever had.
156052,B000TQBEFK,3.0,"I didn't think this resembled honey in any way shape or form. Its more like thin, runny corn syrup. BUT, its not horrible and I think it will work out perfect for certain recipes. I'm going to use mine to make some sugar free / low carb BBQ sauce."

17431,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"I love waking-up to a fabulous cup of coffee.  Newman's special blend Arabica coffee for me leaves nothing to be desired;  taste, aroma, boldness and ease of preparation make this a daily morning must have.  I would certainly recommend that if you are a coffee lover, that you give it a try.  I think it's the best thing since sliced bread.  And Amazon is the way to go, I order when I'm running low and it is at my doorstep the following day.  Really, I don't see how anyone can ask for more."
135673,B003THML30,1.0,"Made the mistake of taking the picture at face value.  As other reviewers have stated, there are actually only 10 bars broken into two pieces.  The price is not $0.74/package, but actually $0.74/bite."
156109,B000LKXC3Q,3.0,"These cookies are hard and crunchy and definitely resemble the store-bought cookies made in mass production bakeries. The taste was good, and the texture similar to somthing from Keebler or another large food processor and baker. I expected these cookies to be more like the gluten-free chocolate chip (or chunk) cookies from Pamela's. Pamela's I would rate with five stars. Overall the Kinnikinnick brand would be fine for kids who want a snack, but gourmet they are not."

127823,B001EO5NJO,1.0,I bought this coffee based on all the positive reviews and the significantly cheaper price than my usual brand.  I find this coffee lacking any Hazelnut Creme flavor.  Perhaps the lack of flavor is due to the fine grind?  Needless to say I will not be purchasing this coffee again.

79398,B003TNANSO,4.0,"I'm excited to try the other KIND bars. I am looking for a low carb and more natural snack bars and I think KIND is a very good choice for that. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is pretty good, although I haven't found a great number of cashews. I've had it in rather hot places and it does kind of lose its shape. That's annoying. Purchasing it through amazon.com was a breeze, I enjoyed having 12 at once and saving. This stuff is okay to buy in bulk because you can consume it so quickly."
82471,B003VIJI1A,4.0,"High marks for PN's quality of ingredients. Except for too much salt, the Pacific Natural ingredient list reads pretty close to how I'd make a homemade batch if I had the time. (FWIW, the red & white canned brand is even higher sodium).<br /><br />As for the salt, one package of the PN packs 2220 mg of sodium - pretty much 100% of the RDA. I find it ironic that Pacific Natural would make this mistake, given that presumably most people buying an organic soup are probably more health conscious than those who do not. As others have noted, this soup is also more garlicky than one might expect a mushroom soup to be. I've found adding some onion powder (unsalted!) and fresh ground pepper offsets the garlic. I wish PN would do this - cut waaay back on the salt and add a bit of onion powder and black pepper to replace some of the garlic. And more mushrooms would be nice.<br /><br />Despite the cons, I prefer the healthier PN brand to the red & white canned stuff. I had given up on having condensed cream of mushroom on hand so was thrilled when I found this brand. It works well in recipes calling for condensed soup, serves as a good gravy base, and makes a nice traditional cup of soup as well."

There is an odd taste to the spice which I can't pinpoint.... even when choosing the right size cup, it still tastes like watered spice barely any pumpkin and even with the help of cream and sugar, I still can't get this to taste good enough for me to finish a whole cup.  This is for my family a wasted purchase as it will just probably end up sitting in the box for a very long time, if I don't throw it out before then."
137280,B000KSTYBS,1.0,"I had tried the Columbian Dark by the same roaster and it was acceptable (Not Great).  Thought this might be better after reading all the positive reviews.  IT IS NOT!  It's almost undrinkable. Bitter/acrid aftertaste that lingers on the tongue long after drinking, and an acid stomach to go with it. I suspect this roast appeals to those who like Charbucks coffee which is almost invariably burned and harsh on the palette.<br /><br />I do like the organic aspect, but in this case that is not nearly enough to redeem this lousy coffee. I am going to give this company one more try and order the Sumatran dark. Keeping my fingers crossed. I've learned not to trust the Amazon coffee reviews very much, but I suspect I'm a lot more finicky with coffee than the average reviewer."

Being an avid searcher for delicious fat-free or low-fat dessert alternatives, this sounded like the absolute MOTHER LOAD!<br />Normally when you open a cake mix box, you get that delightful cake smell that we are all too familiar with... this is not the case with this product. In fact, the product had an almost chalky smell to it. After mixing it with the water, the mix took on a paste smell and after baking there was still no sign that this was supposed to be a dessert. Now I'm stuck with 5 other packs that I have no clue what I'll do with.<br />If you are hungry for a fat free treat, my suggestion would be to go with ""No Pudge Brownies"" and SKIP this horrible excuse for a dessert."

157260,B001E55YXS,3.0,"The beef pot roast with potatoes and carrots is pretty middle of the line for the Hormel meals. The thing that makes me like the red meat meals less than some of the chicken and pasta meals is that they tend to be so salty! (Although make no mistake, there is just as much sodium in all the meals no matter if it tastes salty or not.) The carrots are way too mushy but the potatoes are okay. Much better than any of their mashed potatoes that's for sure. The meat is pretty dry and slightly chewy (which is strange for a meat that just falls apart under your fork) but there's so much gravy that you can almost pretend not to notice. It's not really bad, per say, but not really great either.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison."
152254,B004OVATO8,3.0,"I have tasted every Pure Bar in the Organic line and like them all.  I love the balance of flavors in the line and the raw aspect makes them feel good to eat.<br /><br />I was so excited to taste the Pure Natural Bars Superfruit Nutty Crunch bars that I could hardly wait to get them.  Once I opened the package though, something just didn't hit me right.  I didn't know that these were different from the organic line when I first tasted it.  I knew after the first bite, however.<br /><br />Compared to the Pure Organic Bars which are raw, these are really a disappointment to me.  The flavor is intense, for sure, but it seemed out of balance.  I tasted quite a few different bars just to be sure.<br /><br />The superfruit taste has a tangy aftertaste which is not too bad, but then there is the taste that almost assaults my senses- like over salted peanuts.  The salt in this is not listed as sea salt and it tastes way too strong for my liking.<br /><br />The blueberry pomegranate and cranberry flavor adds nice contrast but the harsh salty peanut taste really interrupts the flow of flavors in my mouth.  I just am not fond of it.<br /><br />As for texture, they are very soft, sticky, and intense in flavor, so that is not a problem.  The texture is very nice as far as crunch balanced with substance and sticky feeling.  The sweet is not overbearing, but is pretty well balanced, much of it coming from the dried fruit.<br /><br />In summary, if you love the Pure Organic Raw bars, you might not like these.  If you love cooked granola bars that are sticky and sweet like sticky buns, and you love peanuts, you might like these.<br /><br />I prefer the raw bars.  My daughter liked them all right, but she eats peanut butter by the pound and dumps half a shaker of salt on many of her meals.  :)  If you are like her, give these a try.  She loves them.  I have given them three stars as an average between her and my reaction to them."

I was very happy with the results and felt a noticeable a little boost in energy but the sweetness of the drink prevented me from rating it five stars.<br /><br />The taste of this drink reminded me of a cherry soda.  It was easy to drink the whole 16 ozs and I felt an increased alertness and little boost of energy for the next 4 hours.  Not being familiar with energy drinks, I was afraid of how it would taste and any after effects but this drink dispelled both of these worries.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this energy drink again since it did provided a boost in energy without any bad after effects."

There are better Amazon deals on this in packs of three and so on. I use this for making mango ice cream.  I use one cup of hvy cream, 1 cup of half and half, 2 cups of Mango pulp...a little vanilla extract.  This is sweetened already, so I added only about another 1/4 cup of sugar.  For the price I got it, it's a good deal.  One other downside for me personally--it is made in a facility that processes peanuts, and I cannot share this with my 5-yr-old granddaughter who is allergic.  For those of you with similar allergy concerns, now you know."

These have probably been sitting on the shelf in a sweltering warehouse for quite some time, which can't be good for the mustard/mayo or the oily soy sauce pack.  That aside, they don't taste too bad actually but nowhere near as good as the other reviews would suggest.  I ordered a couple other Myojo ramen and they seemed fine, so I'm guessing it's just the luck of the draw---ordering food products from Amazon is something of a crapshoot( I've had stale popcorn delivered too)."

They live up to their billing in that they are basically a plethora of nuts and fruits together in bar form, and the taste is quite good.  They certainly are packed full of nuts and fruit, but in the process of holding them together they can become a bit sticky.  The protein content is pretty good as well (5g), and they are not heavy on calories.  The main downside to the bars is the high fat content for a bar.  However, if you are looking for a natural snack, loaded with nuts and fruits this is the bar you will want to pick up."

None of the cans in my shipment had any dents at all, so maybe he just got a bad batch.  Anyway, it's 12 cans of pasta, almost a pound each, for 12 bucks and change.  It's relatively low in fat (even if you eat the whole can which is supposed to be two servings), low in cholesterol, and a can is 18 grams of protein with 10 grams of fiber.  Only the sodium is high, though lower than most canned soups.  It's hearty and satisfying, and the filling is spicier than most canned pastas.<br /><br />Folks, you can't beat an entree like that at a buck a can.

75844,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"No Fear has never been my favorite energy drink, but I'd go to it from time to time because it delivered the energy, thanks largely to the over 180mg of caffeine per can (2 servings...yeah...right). No Fear disappeared and is harder to find now, but here it is, brought by a different bottler and with a different can design, but tasting very much like No Fear always has (despite the claim that it's brand new). I was never a fan of the taste (kind of a tropical fruit, mango taste), as it just seemed cloying and syrupy (not surprising with the amount of sugar in this), but there's no denying the energy boost it gives. Since there's no accounting for taste, take that with a grain of salt (most people seem to prefer the taste over Red Bull). If you're looking for an energy drink that delivers, you can do worse."

I stopped using the hydrometer a long time ago. It's obvious when it's ready to bottle. I prime it with half a cup of cane sugar and bottle it in 2, 1, and 1.5 liter soda bottles. They work great.

82298,B0060JMVM0,4.0,"I like that the Zoe olive oil comes in the metal containers, as opposed to plastic.  The packaging was good; there was not the slightest dent in either can.<br /><br />But there's the BPA thing.  Buying organic, you'd like to know there's not any bpa in the lining of the can, lurking there for months, canceling out part of the benefit of organic.  If Zoe does not tell us, we have to assume the bpa is there, as in other canned foods.  I did a casual search but wasn't able to find out anything specific for Zoe on this. The same casual search turned up many questions about bpa, no definitive answers.<br /><br />I did find a 2003 government sponsored scientific study --- [...] that found BPA was taken up by (absorbed into) olive oil in greater amounts than either water or 3% acetic acid!  Apparently, BPA links with lipid molecules very easily.<br /><br />Why can't we be sure, 8 years later, that BPA isn't leaching into food?  Unfortunately, I found that study link AFTER I'd bought these two tins, so the only thing to do is tranfer contents into glass and refrigerate.  I always keep olive oil refrigerated after opening anyway, in spite of the inconvenience when it solidifies and you have to pour warm water over the container to get it to pour.<br /><br />There's the pouring problem...  I'd read reviews beforehand, so I knew that you had to pull on the green tab to raise the plastic spout.  However, I usually don't pour much at one time, so am still getting a bit of dribble onto the top of the can.  So the plastic spout isn't working for me.  I'm considering glass containers such as the Global Amici drizzlers, just for pouring; this must be a common problem with olive oil.<br /><br />I can't detect anything buttery about Zoe Organic's taste.  And it's not as olive-like a taste as Colavita, for example.<br /><br />Next time, organic or not, I'll try something else for more flavor and to use as a dipping oil.  I'd consider the Zoe special varieties, but apparently they come in plastic containers, with no BPA disavowal in the descriptions.  With so many plastic items being imported from places with little manufacturing controls, it's not sure that any disavowal could be trusted, anyway."
75802,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"The No Fear energy drink, like almost every energy drink out there, does very little to decribe it's flavor.  I can say that this is somewhat grapefruit flavored, which I wasn't expecting.  The flavor though is smoother than actual grapefruit and gave the drink a nice refreshing taste.  I think most people would be surprised by this flavor & the pink color of the drink after seeing the black can with the skull logo.  The taste is odd at first but by the time I had a few drinks, I was enjoying it.<br /><br />As for the contents, the sugar & sodium levels are as expected.  But, the vitamin & supplement content was a little more diverese than most drinks.  I really felt that I got a good blend of extras - besides just caffeine, sugar, and vitamin B's.  This also contained Vitamin C, Zinc, Selenium, Potassium, Grape Seed extract, L-Carnite, L-Arginie, and more.  It did feel like a super energy drink, as the can promoted.<br /><br />For the same price, other drinks don't take this extra step.  Considering the extras & flavor, I was pleasantly surprised!"

Jello is jello is jello and basically there are no surprises. Valued the lack of coloring and unhealthy ingredients. So why do I rate them 3 Stars instead of 4 or more? Well, the company send me an email through amazon promising a little extra if I took the time to review them, which I always almost do anyhow, but since they offered I took them at their word. I know on my first review, prior to this one, I was more generous with the stars system but this time around I am cutting down in the enthusiasm and allocate 3.5.

It has some kick to it, but it's not overpoweringly hot by my standards either.  Don't get me wrong, this stuff is hot, but it's on the milder side of the extract hot sauce spectrum.  I would say it's about 100k-150k on the scoville chart based on my experiences with hot sauces.  It's also thin, so you can use a good amount, and spread it around.<br /><br />However where they went wrong is the taste of this stuff is pretty bad.  The overall consistency and flavor of this sauce is in tube with Louisiana style hot sauces, with the exception of the first and most noticeable taste which is extract.  For those who don't know, extract tastes more or less like battery acid, or so people who have tried both claim (and I have no reason not to believe them).  The second flavor that hit me was vinegar, even though vinegar isn't even the first ingredient.  Third was salt, and fourth was cayenne.  There is no noticeable habanero or ghost pepper flavor in this sauce.  If they used more ghost peppers and less extract, this sauce could have a lot of potential.  Also, the salt is completely unnecessary, as the taste is overwhelmingly bitter -- perhaps a small amount of sugar could have been enough of a bandaid to save this hot sauce.<br /><br />In short, I ended up pouring it down the drain.  If it was the only hot sauce I had, it was passable, but I have an entire shelf full of hot sauces that I look forward to using, and I simply do not have room to store a bottle that I will never use.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  If you want a great tasting Louisiana style hot sauce, try Crazy Uncle Jester's Louisiana Firestorm.  That sauce does have extract but you you taste primarily the serranos and hababeros and the flavor of the extract can be easily overlooked.  Their hotter version, Spontaneous Combusion is also much better -- that has much less pepper flavor, and more extract but it ends up tasting just like Crystal Louisiana style hot sauce, only much hotter.  Red Ghost might have slightly more heat, but you can simply use more Louisiana Firestorm or Spontaneous Combusion and have a lot greater flavor."

What is ""Switch,"" a new refreshing drink  that will dazzle you.<br /><br /> The can is colorful, 8.3 oz, not a large drink,but has a catchy saying - ""100% of what you want 0% of what you don't.""  What does that mean?  According to the can there is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, no corn syrup, and it is 100% juice carbonated.<br />Now, this is definitely a break-thru for those with allergies and those looking for a more 'healthy' drink, especiall children.  But it all comes down to one point, how does it taste.  Let's face it, if it doesn't taste good we probably are not going to drink it, nor will our children, and that's just the honest truth.<br /><br />BLACK CHERRY SWITCH:<br /><br />It was definitely full of the rich flavor of cherry.  If you like that taste you will truly like this one.  It isn't sweet, tends to be on the tart side and has a little punch to it, which was nice in a way, but to me a little overpowering.  Since it was carbonated you felt as if you were drinking a soda, but you were not.  The flavor was pleasant and the drink refreshing, not as good as the Kiwi that I tried, but  different than other drinks which makes it fun.  I don't think I would purchase the cherry flavor of this drink however for personal use, but to each their own. If you want a different drink, that appears to be healthier than soda, Switch is for you."

I rated it at 3 stars due to what you see pictured is not what you will get, plus the packing was just poor and cause more than 1/2 of all of the cups to leak."
157093,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee is a decent coffee, but not a great coffee. I like coffee that is a bit stronger, fuller and smells like full roast coffee. This coffee actually does smell like vanilla, cream and hazelnuts with a hint of caramel. It smells like a specialty coffee drink at Starbucks or better. The issue I have is that the taste doesn't live up the smell. It tastes like a pretty normal medium roast coffee. That is not to say it's bad. I will finish off the pack, but will probably use most of it for company that prefers this sort of thing.<br /><br />For my own personal taste, I like full roast coffees, black with no sugar. Peet's French Roast (yes, I know it is sorta ""burnt"" to some of you). What I really, really like are artisan roasted beans from small shops or from Italy and France. One of my favorites is Castroni, from Rome. This is all to say that this coffee is drinkable, but if not for the Amazon Vine review process, I would not have bought it myself.<br /><br />For a better cuppa from Melitta, try the ""Blanc et Noir"" which is somewhere between medium and full roast. Very smooth and satisfying and you can share it with those who like somewhat less than full-on strong coffee."

123638,B003DA54HS,1.0,"I purchased this bone at a local supermarket and gave it to my boxer. I walked in the house to literally make a cup of coffee and my dog devoured the bone. What a surprise, when the packaging clearly says: ""...this long last chew satisfies your dog's instintive urge to chew."" I didn't think anything about it until 2 hours later when after a walk, my dog regurgitated twice! I checked the vomit and sure enough, there was shards of the bone inside. This stuff was so sharp it actually cut my latex glove! BE CAREFUL. If it could cut my glove, it can damage a dog's stomach, colon, intestines and/or esophogus. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET AND NOT SOLD! There is a disclaimer on the product packaging, ""This is a natural product and may be prone to splintering."" Are you kidding me!? I have been monitoring my dog, whom regurgitated two more times since. Still not sure if I need to go to the vet yet. Gave her 1/3 can of pumpkin to coat her stomach and 3-slices of white bread, which I read will gum up and help her pass any shards in her stomach. Why any company would sell such a product is beyond me. This american made item, lacks the quality to sell in america. I am appalled it is even being sold on the shelves. STAY AWAY. Read the other negative reviews. $3500 for stomach surgery and chances of fatalities. Is it worth it to risk the life of a loved family member over a $3.00 bone! Absolutely not. DO NOT PURCHASE, IT IS UNSAFE."

I thought I'd try Pioneer Valley ""Gourmet"" Boysenberry Syrup even though it cost me about $12 for an 11.5 oz bottle after shipping.  It was not what I expected.  It lacked the same rich boysenberry flavor I had missed in other syrups.  Don't get me wrong,  the ingredients are wholesome.... no water or corn syrup, and boysenberry juice is listed first on the bottle.  In my opinion, the juice gets too diluted with the other ingredients, and a juice concentrate should be used instead."

If the cat gets ahold of the mouse and tries to drag it off it can forcibly spring back up like a slingshot and this can make a considerable amount of noise. I have neighbors upstairs so for their sake I do not use this toy in that location in the evenings or at night. My 9ft ceilings in another room work much better to control the noise and the mouse doesn't get hung up or tangled on the hanger.

At least a third of them were the same flavor from the same maker. When you add that to the number of ""french vanilla"" ones that I got it's at least 2/3 of the box. I wanted an assortment, not mostly french vanilla made by a few different companies. I think I have 5 or 6 that weren't french vanilla.

Also, they nor real weiners have the savory flavor of Big Franks to me. Some people don't like their veggie dogs soft. For those who want their veggie dog to taste exactly like the real thing, I would reccomend another product from this same company - Morning Star Farms veggie dogs. They're in the frozen breakfast section of your local grocery store. They are firm just like real weiners and they have the exact same taste. However, I prefer Big Franks to both of these veggie dogs."
77770,B001LG940E,4.0,"We received out ""Switch"" today. I was curious about how an ""all natural"" soda would taste, having had my palate ""spoiled"" by articificial flavors such as the major brand sodas. When I received it, I wanted to compare it to something comparable such as Cherry Pepsi (my favorite soda).<br /><br />My first impression was that it was very sweet, especially because I first tried it without ice. It's not as sweet as a soda with artificial sweetener but definitely sweeter than some other softdrinks on the market. I did not look at the ingredients until I tried it with ice. With ice, it was definitely more easy going down. The carbonation, overall is not as overpowering and ""gasey"" as regular sodas, but the ice toned down the sweetness to a desirable level. My variety was cherry,but I actually tasted the grape more, than the cherry.<br /><br />The packaging is sleek, and conveys the purpose (appealing to those seeking refreshment, while foregoing all of the mystery incredients found in some other sodas). The message to ""switch"" to this soda is prominently displayed on the can. It is an obvious marketing strategy,but a bit ""obvious"" in its execution-if the drink makes a big splash, I wonder how they will use that blatant message in campaigns. The soda has significant sugar content, so it is not exactly a ""diet"" drink, but it certainly appeals to those that care what is in their drink. Overall, a pleasant experience."

I have been using the Betty Crocker Brownie Mix for over a year and have had mixed (no pun intended) and often disappointing results.  Well, I am SO glad that I gave this one a try!  The brownies are chocolate-y and just the right consistency when baked for the amount of time recommended on the package (I never knew with the Betty Crocker brownies...sometimes they were done, sometimes they weren't).  I don't have to add extra chocolate chips to this mix to get the richness I want in a chocolate brownie.  Another plus is that this mix works just as well with substitutions (I use canola oil instead of butter).  I even baked one batch using applesauce and yogurt instead of oil (moist, fat, brownies were the result).  I like that I can ""de-fat"" them if I want to do so!  I've tried almost every GF brownie mix on the planet and this one is the BEST!  One strange recommendation in the directions is that you freeze the brownies for an hour for best results.  Since I am always in a hurry when I bake these, I haven't done that as yet, but, it hasn't seemed to be a problem!"
75826,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"It's always a bit of a gamble with an unfamiliar energy drink - generally I worry that it taste bad and/or give me the shakes. Thankfully the hefty-sized ""No Fear"" 16-ounce can that I was sent through Amazon Vine had neither. In fact the taste was remarkably nice; kind of like a sweeter redbull and I had no searing chemical after-taste at all. I actually enjoyed the drink from the first opening to the last drop and felt great afterwards.<br /><br />I then went onto to do my very simple workout routine consisting of a couple of miles on the treadmill and some free weights and had no issues, but in all honesty I didn't feel anymore energized or hydrated than normal. One can (which was all that was supplied) and a single workout may not be a sufficient amount of data to be able to say for sure how radical this energy drink could impact my daily exercise regimen though. The ingredients listed consists of the normal fair for this kind of product with taurine being the usual suspect. At 260 cals a can I thought that acceptable given the size of the can too.<br /><br />I felt fine and enjoyed the workout for what it was and felt the drink was nice enough to purchase a full pack of 12 cans. At around fifty cents a can this is very good value for money too, especially given the giant size of the cans."
247891,B004T3QMD8,2.0,"These International coffees by Maxwell House are, in my opinion, expensive. Three dollars(ish) for a can is not too bad, until you realize you need heaping tablespoons to make a decently flavored mug of coffee. If you have big mugs like I do, you have to add even more. Thus, whenever I splurge and get a can (usually a cinnamon flavor or vanilla) I end up adding a tablespoon to my normal, already prepared cup of coffee.<br /><br />This flavor in particular, I was hoping for something better. I love (LOVE!) the Pumpkin Pie flavor cappucinos at 7-11 and really hoped this would be something like it. It wasn't. It's got a bit of spice to it (thus being called Pumpkin Spice) and nothing much else..like pumpkin or vanilla. I realize it was perfectly named, because it really tastes like you put a small, small dash of cinnamon in your coffee and maybe some clove. Very little. Even after following the directions on the can, it just tasted lacking. Also, it has a weird flavor and texture as coffee, which I can't quite explain. Not good either. As for coffee flavor itself, I would say it had very little.<br /><br />The froth was pretty good, nothing like the picture on the can but it was there.<br /><br />Overall I'd give this maybe 2 stars just because it does make your coffee smell and taste like something for Autumn, but overall you need to use too much of this small can to get the flavor the manufacturer probably intended, and that's not too great to begin with."

Cheap, good alternative to something like Zuke's for training (which I cut in half for my dog's training class, since it is a clicker training evening where he stuffs his stomach with tons of treats).  I'm sure they're not as great nutritionally as some other treats, but comes with quite a bit for $4.  My dog likes them, but he's not very picky either.  They're smaller than a centimeter in diameter, and would not be good for a kong because they'd fall out wayyyy too quickly.

The chocolate was the best part, but I found the ginger part tasted grainy mealy and had an unpleasant aftertaste. It also didn't taste much like a ginger cookie. it lacked the real snap of a ginger cookie in taste and texture. The box also arrived with several cookies melted and some damaged which made them unattractive to boot.<br /><br />If you have dietary limitations and need a gluten free item, or want a vegan cookie, thse might appeal to you.

We bought 2 boxes and managed to make them last 4 days (not easy considering how light they are) and tried them with coffee, hot tea and milk. All good but my preference is the hot tea.

The drink itself is better than a few that I've tried thus far. I mix them with protein powder after the gym or sip them on their own. Very tasty. Better than Zico which tasted strange to me.<br /><br />If you order it and get a pack that leaks, call the company and complain. They need to know from anyone who has a leaking product that their product is faulty. It's not amazon as the foil seal on the boxes wasn't secure.

The seller insisted it was Provolone and not Swiss Cheese, He was not very empathic to my concerns. He told me to put the cheese in the refrigerator to harden. The cheese was comprised. It was provolone as stated, however, I would think the seller would know that an item like that should have been shipped over night or at least with dry ice. If he had responded to me and addressed my concerns perhaps the item could have been shipped properly.  I would not order from this seller again. He did give me an option to return the item at my expense. I decided rather then spend another $6.00 S&H (total for 1 lb chesse not eaten $26.00) it was more cost effective just to throw it out.

77054,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"""Back to Nature"" Chocolate Delight Granola was certainly a pleasant surprise.  I have always been a fan of granola bars, oatmeal, and, of course, chocolate, but I never expected to enjoy this food quite as much as I did.  The taste is not merely the blandness of oats or the sugary sweetness of the chocolate but a wonderful combination of the two, neither of which comes across as overpowering but as a subtle, healthy snack for one to eat.  If you are interested in this product, you might also be most interested to note the excessive fiber content, which is another of granola's additional benefits.<br /><br />Any complaint I have regarding the product is purely logistical.  Let's be honest: eating loose, bulk granola isn't easy.  I dropped as much on my floor as I put in my mouth.  I suppose the most effective method of eating the granola would be to put it in a bowl and spoon it like cereal, but that eliminates the ability for the product to be carried around for a snack, taken camping, etc.  While one cannot as easily control the portion size of granola bars, they remain a much easier and more effective method of consumption than loose granola."

136393,B006Q820X0,1.0,"We have been drinking the French Roast from Tully, Green Mountain, and Starbucks. We decided to give the French Roast from Brooklyn Bean Roastery a try. What a dissapointment.<br /><br />First, the taste is extremely weak if we set the brewing to ""12"". So we have to change it to brew at ""8"".<br />If we brew it at 12, it taste almost like tea. Actually to get the strength as strong as the other well known competitors we have to set the brew at ""6"". So basically eventhough the price of these is cheaper, you won't save money as you have to use almost twice as much! We went through the whole box (36 k-cups) and all of them have the same consistency, in order to get a strong blend we have to set the brew at ""6"" or ""8"". Compare to Tully, Green Mountain, or Starbucks, with setting to ""12"" we always get a very strong coffee. After all, French Roast is suppose to be a fairly strong coffee."
167624,B006BXUZVO,3.0,"I read a few other reviews here, one said there were hardly any almonds, and another said the cinnamon was barely noticeable. Maybe they each got a bad box, because the one sent to me has lots of almonds, and I could instantly taste the cinnamon.<br /><br />It's a surprisingly nice combination of flavors - bran flakes, raisins, almonds, and cinnamon, but as I always find with most, if not all, breakfast cereals, it's way too sweet. If they eliminated half the sugar, I'd probably be a buyer, but not as it is."
77124,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I love granola and I love chocolate, so I couldn't help but like this granola.  The crunch is good, the taste of the granola is quite nice and the chocolate is some of the best I've had when compared to other pre-packaged store-bought items.  However, the overall taste of the granola is just too sweet for me.  It's best in very small quantities, such as on some tart vanilla yogurt or a small half handful for a snack.  I once tried eating the full half cup serving size and by the end of the snack I felt like I'd eaten a bunch of cookies due to the sweetness.  You could never eat this as a cereal, it's really sort of a dessert granola.<br /><br />The ingredients are the best I've seen in a pre-packaged food in a while, although there are a lot of sweeteners of various kinds.  The price on this item is really good, as local stores sell granola bags in this size for $6 or more per bag.<br /><br />If you like sweet, I really recommend this.  If you're looking for something to eat in very small amounts or to add to other things like yogurt, this will also be for you."

148604,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"The binder ingredient in this large snack bar is crisped rice so it tastes like a ""Rice Crispy Treat"" with peanuts inside. The crispy rice forms the dominant texture of the bar.  An occasional peanut is not enough to give the rich meaty crunch of a handful of roast peanuts which I was expecting from the picture on the box.  The dominant flavor comes from the coating of sweet peanut butter on the bottom of the bar.  Because the sweetening is corn syrup, the bar is sweet but the flavor is not remarkable or distinctive.  Certainly the ""Double Peanut"" marketing implies one thing, but I find the bar disappointing and the peanut butter undercoat is messy in warm weather.<br /><br />However, there are worse snacks!  Each bar offers 100% of vitamin E, no cholesterol and no trans fats.  There's a reasonable amount of sodium and 7 grams of protein per bar.  A decent energy snack and a quick pick-me-up when the blood sugar is running low."

17736,B000Z978SS,5.0,"Since switching to a low carb diet, Erythritol and Xylitol have become my friends.  Each has its own pros and cons, so I mix them.  Erythritol doesn't cause as much gas, but it leaves a cool sensation in the mouth which can be distracting.  Xylitol is good for your teeth, but may make some people feel like the Hindenburg.  Both taste sweet and don't leave an aftertaste.  So I figure the best bet is to buy a bag of each and mix them together.  Note that both these products are small crystals which do not dissolve very easily in liquid.  The best way around this is to pulverize them with a coffee grinder.  Just a few seconds will break up the crystals into a powder which will dissolve just fine."

I have been buying the Gloria and Green Mountain original hot chocolates because they are only 1 WW (Weight Watcher) points.  However, they always tasted watery and were just something I drank out of necessity to fill the void of snacking.<br /><br />Fast forward 50 pounds lighter and I purchased the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte and Dark Hot Chocolate at Bed Bath and Beyond (because it was all they carried and Amazon quit carrying the other brands) and I have never been so surprised!  What a fantastic flavor!  The Latte is 2 WW points and the Dark hot chocolate is 1 WW point.  I can even use the highest water option and I still get a rich full taste.<br /><br />If you are looking for an alternative to coffee, this will not disappoint!<br /><br />The only way I could be happier this Holiday Season if Amazon started carrying this product with Prime shipping!"

247379,B002YRBAVK,2.0,"I bought this to replace my supply of coconut flour and was excited because I got this so cheap.  I am on a high fat/high protein ""Primal"" diet and I make waffles and tortilla/crepes with coconut flour.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could tell something was amiss when I opened the product as the consistency of the flour was very....floury.  Real coconut flour is loaded with healthy fat and cannot take on such a consistency.<br /><br />I looked on the bag and saw that the produce is a Coconut Flour >>>BLEND&lt;&lt;&lt; with the #1 ingredient being Rice Flour!  This is why it can be sold for so cheap...because the majority of the product is made from cheap, powdered rice.  Coconut flour is more expensive.<br /><br />You should know that rice is a grain and thus is a carbohydrate.  It might be gluten free, yes, so you don't get those nasty effects, but it's not a ""low carb"" food which meshes with ""Paleo"" or ""Primal"" approaches to eating.<br /><br />I'm eating the stuff slowly, as I'm not going to throw it away and waste money, but I won't be buying it again."

Well i actually made her take them home but she tossed them. Do not even buy even for 6 cans for $5. If you get these for free well it helps you live but you will not enjoy the taste.

So even without detailed pictures of BOTH the front and back labels OR the having ingredients listed on this product's description, I purchased this item. When it arrived I was very disappointed because this product contains only 10% juice!<br /><br />This ""flavored beverage"" is a juice drink in my estimation and an expensive one at that. The first two ingredients are: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup...I'm so confused about what actually is considered: Juice, Juice Cocktail, Juice Drink, Flavored Water and/or how much juice is really in each of them. The consumer is at the short end of this confusion and this deal in particular."

79544,B003TNANSO,4.0,I love the Kind Almond coconut bars so I decided to try the peanut butter dark chocolate.  It arrived in a box of 12 and all appear fresh.  The bars are both gooey and crunchy.  It is tastey but not as good as the almond coconut.  Very peanutty with a little but of nice dark chocolate.  I like that it is higher protein and that I get to feel like a I had a candy bar but without the crash of eating way too much sugar.  This bar is good but not my favorite

But, if you're looking for a nice ebergy drink to get you through those last hard hours, it is a good buy."
155429,B000GAT6NG,3.0,"I used this for many months a few years ago. By using it I was able to stay off of my biggest vice; sugar. I lost some weight on it, and had more energy while I was using it. However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things."
249582,B001LGGH54,2.0,"Our family is addicted to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC734G"">Izze Sparkling Juice Variety Pack - 12/12 Oz Btls</a> during the summers so we gave these a try, mostly because of the additional flavors.  Unfortunately rather than the refreshing, more understated tastes of Izzies, this soda has a more syrupy Jolly Rancher flavor.  My seven year-old gives this 5 stars, but it is a little too much for an adult palette.<br /><br />We still appreciate a soda replacement with no added sugar or preservatives.  It saves a little on the guilt.  We also tried Switch's Kiwi Berry which was not as sickeningly sweet for adults and still a hit with kids, but we will be getting Izzies for treats on a hot summer day."

This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience, but since the chocolate will be further processed, it probably won't be as good. However, it also received positive reviews."

79761,B001IZM92S,4.0,"This was my first try with organic dried apples.  I have decided to avoid pesticide ridden fresh and dried apples.  When the package arrived I was a little disturbed at the lack of labeling of any kind.  They were identified as Bare Fruit Fuji Apples packaged for Amazon, with an address for Bare Fruits. Weight one pound. That was it.  No use by date, or any kind of a freshness indicator. No ingredients list, though I assume the ingredients are just apples.  But how can I know for sure?  They came in a sturdy silver mylar type bag, very well padded for shipping.  I haven't come up with a way to reclose the bag for freshness.  Even my vacuum sealer system, which works on most mylar bags will not reseal this one.  My first try at the chips themselves was a little disappointing.  Many of the pieces were almost too small for munching.  The taste and texture was foreign to me.  But then a little later in the day I was surprised that I wanted more.  Maybe taste buds just need a chance to get accustomed to a new thing.  Now I love them. The Fuji taste comes through beautifully,  They are slightly crunchy without being hard straight from the bag.  I have also thrown a handful in in place of other fruit when making oatmeal in the morning.  When added in the last minute or so of cooking, they come out plump and flavorful.  My husband is taking them instead of potato chips with his lunch and finds them to be a satisfying mid afternoon snack. I am now thinking of other ways to try them, both rehydrated and dry.  Maybe in muffins?  Rehydrate in maple syrup to use on pancakes?  Or could I use them as an alternative to peeling and slicing apples for pie?  Two one pound bags is alot of apples, and since I don't know how long they will stay fresh I am ready to explore."

The unaffected K-Cups brew excellent cups of tea, and I would recommend this product once Twinings fixes the issue with the foil lid."

I wanted to like it more, as the price is reasonable, and the portion size and calorie count are good, but it's just too minty for me."

Try the Sarsaparilla or Birch Beer mix if you want a different old-fashioned variety. This stuff is great for flavoring homemade ice cream too."

163994,B007G93BEK,3.0,"I love white teas and have really enjoyed experimenting with different flavors through Teavana.  Youthberry, White Ayurvedic Chai and Spice of Life are a few of my favorites.  The description of ingredients for Frutto Bianco pearls seems heavenly: kiwi, coconut, and tropical fruit bits.  I read several customer reviews that equated their experience of drinking this tea to lying on a beach in Hawaii (which definitely enticed me!)  However, after thoroughly enjoying most other Teavana white teas, this one was a disappointment.  The aroma (one of my favorite things about these teas) was very mild and not altogether pleasant.  Once brewed, the flavor was just blah.  I only bought a few ounces of it, but it is still here 5 months later.  I am now mixing it up with my other teas just to use it up.  If you prefer a more mellow taste, this may be more appealing to you (and my 7 year old daughter does enjoy the aroma of this one).  Once nice thing about this tea are the ""pearls,"" these white tea leaves are even more unprocessed than other forms and present as lovely round spheres which slowly unfurl once they are brewed."

I think the new one was fresh, but I just cant bring myself to drink any of it because it still smells foul.  This product is just plain horrible, plan and simple.

125113,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"As another reviewer has noted, Lindt has changed their previously great recipe as of Autumn 2010, and this chocolate now has the texture and taste of bottom-shelf waxy, cheap American dark chocolate.  Not even mediocre American dark chocolate, but BAD American dark chocolate.  It reminded me of the candy you got behind the windows of an Advent Calendar when you were a kid.<br /><br />This is unfortunate, and apparently, this new recipe has been incorporated into all of their dark chocolate with the possible exception of the 85% version.<br /><br />Avoid this, as this is now one of the worst chocolate bars on the market at any cost.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of 11/10/2010, I've started to see the regular recipe bars re-appear on shelves.  Hopefully this isn't just old stock, but instead a sign that Lindt got the hint and has reverted to the excellent old recipe."

The only better was a Japanese mix that came the same way, with two pouches: a miso paste, and a packet of dried seaweed and tofu.<br /><br />Unfortunately at 1000mg of sodium per serving, this isn't the most healthy stuff. It may be organic and vegan, but that's a horrific amount of sodium.  Miso is created with salt and is naturally full of sodium, but this paste has additional salt added as well.

The seller called and assured me that they would arrive on time.  The package was sent in 2 separate boxes (one sent priority mail the other sent express mail.  Only one box arrived on time. I only had half of the amount of party favors for my son's party.  This was probably a mistake in shipping by the sender, but nonetheless a problem.<br /><br />The chocolates themselves are wonderful.  They taste great and look awesome.  If you decide to purchase this product, I would suggest you talk to the seller and make sure that the shipping is made on time to arrive for your event.  If you can get some sort of guarantee shipping date that would be great too."
124887,B005BHIESC,1.0,"I was hesitant of buying this product since there were so many mixed reviews. I decided to try it since I enjoy coconut water. I have been to the Caribbean and enjoyed water coconuts and fresh exotic fruits, so I thought I would love this. I was excited when this arrived. I opened it up and the smell threw me back. When I twisted the cap, the pouring spout ripped away from the carton, which made the ease of storing much more difficult. I tried a sip and it was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. It tasted bitter and it smelled like burnt rubber. I have tried several of the exotic fruits listed in the ingredients, but this drink tasted nothing like them. I tried chilling it to see if it made the taste better and there was no improvement. If you are expecting this to taste like real coconut water, you will surely be disappointed. Fortunately I purchased this on Amazon and their customer service has been awesome and taking care of this issue."
17067,B000F2VESU,5.0,"My mother is Thai, so I grew up eating a lot of sticky rice. The last time I went to visit her (she lives 4 hours away), she forced me to take home the pot and basket to make it, and she also provided me some rice. Once that ran out, I looked up where the closest Thai market was from me, and found one 30 minutes away. Due to feeling a little lazy, I opted to order this instead. I just made some tonight and it's PERFECT! It turned out just like my mom's sticky rice. When it runs out, I might venture out to the Thai market to see if I can get it for cheaper. But I didn't mind paying more for the convenience."

I expected to find this huge box in the mail and instead I get a puny, little padded shipping envelope.  I wrote a complaint and got my money back complete with an apology and a witty comment that I rather enjoyed.  Either way, $20 (shipping included) is nowhere near worth being paid for a pound of anything shy of precious metals and gems.<br /><br />The candy is excellent...the price, and expected amount....not so much."

161622,B0002AZWX8,3.0,"When I lived in Greece in the Seventies, I insisted on drinking what the old people drank, namely Turkish coffee (""emeis to leme elleniko"" - ""we call it Greek"" said a blurb on the package). However, Greek youth frequently spurned such stuff and drank instead the ""frappes"" made from the product you see here. To each their own. However, I've found a different use for it these latter days: I carry it on camping, and, especially, backpacking trips. Since it doesn't need, really, to be heated, there's no messing about with stoves and cleaning. How does it taste? Well, you can't have everything. But if you're addicted to coffee, and heat is unavailable or inconvenient, here's a product that might serve your purpose. Or perhaps prove that you're not the old-fashioned sort of Greek."
76984,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I really enjoyed the taste and texture of the Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola.  The granola clusters are good and not overly sweet and the chocolate is more a hint than an overpowering ingredient.  I'm not sure that I would eat this for breakfast (it feels a bit decadent with 1/2 cup for 200 calories), but it's the perfect treat for an afternoon snack or in place of desert.  If your watching calories, carefully measure your portions as this is so tasty that it'd be easy to eat the whole bag in one sitting.<br /><br />The only fault I found with this product was that some of the chocolate in the sample I received was melted and stuck to the sides of the bag, making it a bit messy if you're an ""eat from the bag"" granola consumer like my husband.<br /><br />A tasty treat - would definitely recommend!"

I only gave them a few pieces of this cat treat before I remembered that this brand was bad. It was not a pretty picture. I believe the problem might be all of the vegetables they have put in this. It looks great to people (vegies are supposed to be good, right?), but cats are obligate carnivores, and all this grain and vegies isn't good for them. Don't buy this unless you enjoy cleaning crap off of your floors."
255020,B001BLXTRI,2.0,Product arrived on time and was well packed.  The first problem was that one jar was not closed tight and  the half the honey leaked out into the packing.  The second thing we found was the honey was very thin and could be poured like water.  The flavor was good but you had to be very careful putting it on bread as it would soak through the bread very fast. I would not recommend this product.
17991,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"I've been using the PB2 in my protein shakes and I've been quite pleased. When mixed in, the flavor profile is different than traditional PB such as Skippy or JIF, but still tastes like a quality, full flavored peanut butter. The flavor is potent, and one half serving is usually sufficient to flavor a smoothie made with 1.5cups milk/banana/whey. It mixes well and produces a consistency similar to that of regular peanut butter. At 45calories I've found it an excellent replacement."

17997,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,I love this peanut butter. It has 25% of the calories of regular peanut butter and tastes great with a good texture. Don't make it up ahead unless you put it in the fridge.  It will spoil but lasts days if refrigerated. I buy it from netrition for less than 6 dollars a jar with a six dollar shipping fee for my order.  Also very fast shipping.<br />With most things amazon is a better deal but not in the case of some of these less common food items.

It is so good I'm signing up for auto delivery.<br /><br />If you like peaches and tea, this is the blend for you.<br /><br />As a side note I add about a 1 tablespoon of quality black tea to the 8 tablespoons of Peach Passion.

252842,B000BY50BY,2.0,"I'm certainly no expert on the anatomy of cows. Nor are my dogs. But everyone noticed when suddenly our long-time favorites, Cadet's Beef Tendons, definitely changed. For the worse. We don't buy them anymore - whatever they are now.<br /><br />For over a year, I would order a new 1 pound bag about every six weeks. We have a Papillion-mix and two purebred Dachshunds, who are insanely hardworking chewers. Obsessive, possessive, and picky, too. Well, with those three and the frequent visits of the extended family's dogs, those tendons were hugely popular and went fast.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm no expert, but I can describe what we used to get: long, thick, chewy but tough, slightly moist, meaty, rope-like things, with occasional shapes that definitely resembled my limited understanding of tendons. I even have some experience with beef shin tendons, having also frequently purchased Butcher's Block ""Grand Royale"" beef shins for my girls. Those came complete with the tendons, which I carefully remove with a knife to create two treats out of one.<br /><br />So a few months ago, the much-anticipated regular delivery of ""tendons"" arrived, we were stumped to find flat, dry slabs with sharp edges that look like old jerky. They look NOTHING like the old beef tendons. And my dogs completely ignored them. I though it was a fluke. After two more orders of the same things, I gave up.<br /><br />I can't say what part of the cow the ""new"" ""beef tendons"" are, but I can say that my dogs can't stand whatever they are now, and we no longer purchase anything from Cadet.<br /><br />I'm awfully disappointed - those original tendons would keep my frauleins happy and distracted from picking fights with the mademoiselle for hours. So far, we've found nothing nearly as good.<br /><br />TL;DR BREAKDOWN:<br /><br />Product went from:<br /><br />- Thick, meaty, chewy, semi-moist, ropey, treats my dogs chewed for hours, even days<br /><br />to<br /><br />- flat, stringy, sharp-edged, dried-out slabs that look nothing like the previous treats, and my dogs won't touch 'em<br /><br />What happened?<br /><br /> For a pretty good replacement I recommend Butcher's Block ""Grand Royale"" real beef shins for dogs, but do be a wise consumer and price-check, for you might be amazed at the difference between vendors. Also, fyi, they're messier and more . . . livestock-like, but if your dogs loved the old Cadet tendons, they'll probably like the Grand Royale. Mine do. But we miss the easy-peasy big bag of Cadet tendons. :(<br /><br />If they change back, somebody please let me know!!"

We enjoyed every bit of it but had trouble finding more until it turned up on Amazon.  Smells great, tastes great, and is made with real ingredients (not artificial sweeteners and weird chemicals).  Really fantastic stuff.  It's also great in brownies and cakes - adds some spices above and beyond what most people expect.  Tastes like fall, in the best way possible.  Here's a recipe to try:  a few frozen bananas (for chill and body), about a  cup of crunchy peanut butter, about half a cup of almond or regular or soy milk (more milk if you like a thinner shake), a scoop of this cocoa, and blend.  Drink it right away.  Filling, lots of vitamins, and naturally sweet.  I know people who swear by it as their daily breakfast.  Yum!"

When I added it to my tacos, it felt like I had added a strange tasting ranch to it (no improvement when combined with other taco toppings/seasonings). I threw it in the garbage after a few days.

243707,B000SAPXGS,2.0,"I am a big tea fan and, with decent reviews and a great price, thought this would be a great tea.<br /><br />The tea I received was exactly as I expected but my first concern was when I opened it and smelled it.  Sure it smelled like tea but I could not smell any mint.  I've bought the Boston Tea Moroccan Mint before and it has a nice minty smell.<br /><br />Still, I figured once I brewed it I could surely taste it.  Nope.  This just tasted like regular green tea.  So, it gets two stars for actually being / tasting like green tea but it tasted like a sub-par tea without any mint added.  Nothing special.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Back to Boston Tea for me."
253439,B004JRMG98,2.0,"The most distinctive qualities of this sauce are its light green color and creaminess. The sauce has a slightly hot flavor, that is, where the hotness is provided by that most famous of spicey molecules, ""capsaicin."" Capsaicin is what makes peppers naturally not. At any rate, the good folks in Iowa who work tirelessly to put corn and pork on the table, might consider this sauce to be adventuresome or ""out there."" However, folks from the San Francisco Bay area, where practically every block contains a Thai restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, or a Korean restaurant, will find this sauce to be bland or tame. Thus, although the label reads, ""BOLD & CREAMY,"" it cannot be said that the flavor of this product is ""bold."" In view of the fact that the product is called, ""Jalapeno Sauce,"" I would expect to find crunchy bits or slivvers of jalapeno peppers or, if not that, crunchy bits or slivvers of ordinary bell peppers. But there are no crunchy things. There are some tiny specks, perhaps measuring having a length of one millimeter. In addition to the hot flavor of this product, it does seem to have the typical flavor of a pepper (this flavor could be classified as bitter, since the flavor is not sweet and not sour). But in my opinion, this bitter flavor should have been a bit stronger. Food chemists have synthesized the pepper flavor molecule (I am not referring here to capsaicin), and I would have appreciated a product with a bit more of this pepper flavor molecule. Also, I would have liked to see a product that is darker green. The sauce is light green -- there are no jalepenos that are colored light green. Jalepenos are only dark green or red. But now, I think I will be more honest. While this ""sauce"" does have a mild hot flavor, it is notably lacking in any other flavor. The light-green color gives me the creeps."
247487,B000FFLTM8,2.0,I bought this because I got reading all the fantastic 5 star reviews. This stuff is so terrible I couldn't take more than a few bites and threw the rest in the garbage. Now I'm stuck with 5 more soups left that I'll just donate to the homeless.
158134,B0058PEGES,3.0,"I purchased 'Natural Balance 3-Ounce Platefuls Indoor Mackerel and Sardine Formula in Gravy Entree for Cats', but no where was it advertised that the food comes in large square shaped pieces of meat.  I don't know if all their cat food varieties comes in this large square shape or not, but my cats prefer to eat ground meat or meat that comes as a 'pate'.  The Squares of mackerel & sardines are very big and all my cats do is to lick out all the gravy and leave behind most of these squares of food. When you purchase fancy feast cat food, they pretty much tell you what the form of the food is like inside of the can.  So does 9-lives, but unfortunately, 'Natural Balance' did not say this at all.  I recall purchasing mackerel by 'Merrick' as they put in their food actual pieces of 'mackerel' as they come off the fish itself just as 'Petite Cuisine' has flakes of fish in them also.  This my cat loves! But this is not the case with Natural Balance.  It's like the consistency of the meat that you eat when you're eating a 'Gyro'.  I guess my cats are too lazy to chew them, and so I'm stuck with them, as I purchased a case of 24.  I have 3 cats that are indoor cats and one cat that I feed only outdoors because he's feral.<br />Not even my feral cat and his buddy will eat it.  They too just lick out the gravy!<br />Natural Balance is not sold in my neighborhood.  If they were I would have tried out a packet first.  I'm sure that they are a very healthy food, and this food also has a few bits of vegetables in them which my cat did eat since the vegetables appear very small in size.  I was so sure that they were going to be a hit! I'm afraid that I'm a bit disappointed."
151628,B001WRHQRA,3.0,Pumpkin Spice was too weak in the spice flavors for me.  I brewed a second cup and used less water and it wasn't much better.  Will not buy it again.

151112,B001Q9EFW8,3.0,"These biscuits are probably better than nothing, and they did seem to clean some of the yellowish gunk off his teeth; after three of these over the span of a weekend, my dog's teeth were noticeably whiter, although spots of tartar and plaque remained in the remoter portions of his teeth.<br /><br />I generally prefer organic dog food with short, simple ingredient lists, and at first was a little concerned when I saw that the  list on these things was half the height of the box. However, spot checking the ingredients shows that most of them (Calcium Pantothenate or Pyridoxine Hydrochloride for example) were just vitamin supplements; a few were harder to decipher, though (Sodium Hexametaphosphate?)  The most common ingredient is wheat, so if your dog has a wheat allergy, avoid these.<br /><br />As to taste, I refrained from trying them myself, but it did seem a bit dryer and more powdery than other treats I feed him; he didn't seem as wildly enthusiastic about them as he is about his organic kibble, but he sure ate every speck, and started noticing when I got the box out. (To be fair, he'd probably eat bark if I put it in a bowl with some kibble and water).<br /><br />Overall, these are probably a good option if you want to do something for your dog's teeth; they're certainly far cheaper than the other dog dental treats I've seen for sale. I don't think they're going to be an adequate substitute for getting your dog's teeth cleaned at the vet, though."

The regular Fluff is delicious and you can eat it by the spoonfuls, and it has few calories. This one, well, I don't know what it is. It tastes horrible. I could not swallow it. I had to spit it out. They won't pay for shipment back, so don't buy it in the first instancce. Whatever positive remarks there are, are probably by the owners or the employees. No human being could possibly like this."

152222,B004OVATO8,3.0,"There's a lot to like with these bars. They're a lot healthier than some other bars out there and the company seems to be commited to quality food. In the end though this particular flavor just didn't do it for me. On the go I would likely reach for something that pleased my palate more. If I was intentionally looking for something healthy I would pack some of these away. On quality and composition I would rate them higher, but taste counts for something too..."

I was excited to put my cats on this food after doing extensive research because it was high in protein, grain-free and had several great reviews. I had them on Innova Senior, but it was a little dry and they didn't really ""love"" the food. However, since starting to feed Wellness CORE a few days ago, my kitties have both had diarrhea every time they use the litterbox. I've owned both cats their entire lives, and they've never had diarrhea before and it's the only thing that's changed in their diet (they also get Wellness wet food at night). Although I already have them on a relatively high protein, low carb diet, I think the even higher level of protein and fat in this food might be too much for their digestive tracts to handle. I have stopped feeding this food and expect the condition to clear up soon."

I'm not sure how, but the vanilla flavor somehow makes the tea taste thicker.  I know that sounds weird, and maybe not super delicious to some of you, but I mean it in a good way. :)  I guess it makes it taste more luxurious...like the consistency of good hot cocoa."
149277,B0019LTJ7O,3.0,"Although I love coconut oil and know of all the benficial ways to use it, this coconut oil tastes too coconutty for me.

It almost makes me gag.  I'll be going with Nutiva next time."
136257,B001HTMVUA,1.0,"I grabbed this from the free snacks Kids Korner at Whole Foods. While my one and a half year old ate it because she was hungry for lunch, one bite was too much for me. It was sickeningly sweet. Eight grams of sugar isn't too much, but I'm used the the taste of Kashi granola bars, which don't come near the sweetness of these. Rice Krispy treats made according to the recipe with marshmallows don't even taste as sweet. It didn't taste like fruit but like some bad artificial flavor attempting to mimic fruit but falling way short. I'm sorry to be writing such a strong reaction, but this product was just yucky tasting. I don't plan on ever trying anything else from this brand. I'll stick with Kashi."
157121,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"For my taste, it is mild coffee: I needed to use two tablespoonfuls per 8 oz cup instead of two teaspoonfuls per 6 oz cup as recommended on the label.  Aroma is not strong either. Hazelnut flavor is a question of personal taste but I prefer it and creme brl&eacute;e  with desert. It is very finely ground coffee and may not work with all filter less coffee makers.<br /><br />Conclusion - just an average mild coffee, nothing extraordinary."
18019,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,I added two tablespoons of it to my chocolate protein and vanilla soy milk with a few slices of bananna.  It was delicious.  Tasted just like my smoothies with regular peanut butter. It cut out 160 calories and 14.8 grams of fat.
80290,B004342XH2,4.0,"I've tried a couple different Hot Chocolate K-cups and so far I think we like this one the best.  We love having it around so we can give the kids hot chocolate, or just curl up as the weather gets cooler and make a cup ourselves.  It's chocolatey but if it tastes too watered down like some suggest, then just set your settings to a smaller cup size.<br /><br />For us, it's just right!  Creamy, chocolatey, warm and delicious!  Give it a try if you like K-cups and hot chocolate!  Why not?  There are great k-cups coming up for the winter months, and this one is definitely going to stay stocked throughout the winter.  YUM!"
17932,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.

249624,B001LGGH54,2.0,"I reviewed a different flavour- the Kiwi Berry, which was pretty nasty. This Watermelon Strawberry faired a bit better. It wasn't cavity sweet, but it wasn't entirely pleasant either. I actually managed to finish the can. It is slightly carbonated, not nearly as much as regular soda, so I didn't mind it, and has 100% Vitamin C which is good. I'm not sure if I would recommend this product, or this line of products. Even those who like soda may not like something like this because of the false sweetness factor and those who live on water may not appreciate this new type of drink either-I certainly don't. I certainly don't think the price is worth it. Not even close."
254552,B000R923TU,2.0,Most of the cans inside the box were badly damaged. Will be very hard to open them. This is very disappointing since I signed up to receive this product as a subscriber.
16908,B001LGGH40,5.0,"Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />I had this with chips and it wasn't a great combination, so I had the drink by itself and it was much, much better. The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this flavor, so I will surely look into the other flavors available, most likely the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">watermelon strawberry</a> since I'll probably get a similar taste. Oh, and the can is cool too - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling."

The taste is great as always, but one of my boxes was damaged in shipping and leaked all over my laundry room.  I should have contacted the retailer to get it replaced but I just mopped up the mess and made a mental note to cancel my subscription and order a smaller size.  I do wish they would address the shipping/packing problem as it has been mentioned more than once on this site.

I personally like the flavor and texture of slightly-chewy dried apples better, so 2 pounds is a lot for me to get through. If you prefer crispy dried apples through, these are for you. I understand what another reviewer meant by a ""musty"" flavor in some of the chips; it makes them a little less appealing though not inedible and I think it's just the nature of the product."
164819,B000VA3YVG,3.0,"O.K., I'm a snack addict and decided it was time to check out some healthier foods. After reading the reviews on this product I decided to try them.I thought at first,  what a waste of money ! They were bland and just tasted like freeze dried french fries.

Eating healthy is a priority for me and these help."

Every time I eat them I have a heartburn.

17148,B003VVL8NS,5.0,"The last place I bought a Bonomo's Turkish Taffy bar was at a 7-11 convenience store in Orlando, FL. It was 1974 and I was 14 years old. Devastating, I know!<br /><br />As a military brat, service member and spouse, I have looked for genuine Turkish Taffy in nearly every corner of the earth only to discover that the recipe had been sold and then shelved without a single batch being made. I've made several attempts along the way to find something similar but all fell way short of satisfying. Plain salt-water taffy was okay but it was always too soft and airy. Then there was Doscher's French Chew taffy bar that purportedly is as close to Turkish Taffy as it gets. All I can say is, ""ICK!""<br /><br />Now, before we get to the bottom line here you need to know that unlike so many others folks, cracking a Bonomo's was not necessarily an option in FL unless you took it home and stuck it in the fridge for a while (longer than the recommended five minutes). I suppose that might work if you lived next door to the 7-11 but who could wait that long? So, before leaving the store, I would already be peeling back the wrapper on my taffy bar and sinking my teeth in only to find that my teeth would be locked shut in the thick gooey taffy. Mmmm - Heaven!<br /><br />Back in the present, I finally received my box of Bonomo's Vanilla Taffy today - the ONLY flavor worth sinking my teeth into. Unfortunately, there was no way I'd be able to do so. Living in the Blue Ridge Mountains in NC, my taffy had apparently been sitting on a truck stuck in the snow for several days before they finally were able to make it up to our house. To my great disappointment the first bar out of the box was already cracked. I had no choice but to rip open the wrapper like the 14 year old I wish I still were and slip the very first cracked piece ever into my mouth with much anticipation.<br /><br />I was not disappointed!<br /><br />It's funny how the taste of certain foods remain with you, no matter how long it's been since you last had them. Like the original Liege Belgian waffles we used to get in the market a few blocks from our home in Brussels when I was eight years old. I returned to Brussels and that market several times in the late nineties and sure enough - those waffles were just as sweet, sticky with syrup from the partially dissolved ""perle"" sugar.<br /><br />And so it is with the new Bonomo's vanilla flavored Turkish Taffy. Thirty six years later and still, unmistakably genuine Bonomo's Turkish Taffy. Now to find a way to soften it just enough to get my teeth stuck in it again.<br /><br />I am now contemplating whether I should buy several cases of this stuff - enough to last 36 years perhaps. You know, just in case they stop making it again."

I'm used to a minimum of 85% cocoa content, but was looking for other bars with nuts. This bar does not have the crunchiness you would expect of such product. Going back to my smooth, rich, dark chocolate bars. BTW, the bulk is too expensive on amazon; it's cheaper to buy from walmart or your local grocery store."

Hershey uses vanillin...which is a wood extract..I have a bag that was given to me, and all I do is snack on it, letting it melt on my tongue to taste the almost orgasmic caramel flavor that stays with you for like ten minutes after eating it. Which ever chocolate you eat, let it melt on your tongue first instead of chomping on it. One, you eat less, and two, you appreciate it, and three, you can taste all the flavors."

For all you health nuts, this may not be the product for you.  2nd and most of all, you can't really eat this without getting your hands full of the peanut butter.  The bar is made up of nuts on the top with an underlayment of peanut butter on the bottom.  This means you can't eat the bar without the wrapper otherwise your fingers will melt the peanut butter and get all messy.  It would be better if the bar had the peanut butter ""sandwiched"" between two layers of peanuts.  Less mess and you won't need the wrapper."
16631,B001LGGH40,5.0,This drink is a great alternative to soda. It has a little bit more sugar than soda but this has better ingredients than a regular soda can. It is a little pricey for a pack of 24 but it is better for you and it taste great.
150772,B006AA5JKA,3.0,"I really enjoy Ahmad English tea #1, so I tried thier Earl Grey. It has an astringent aftertaste, is too strong, and this particular box has no individual packaging to seal the flavor in. I prefer not to use foil wrapped products for environmental reasons but these packets need to be in an airtight container so as not to loose thier flavor. I really cannot taste much bergamot which is what I enjoy about an Earl Grey. Also, it smells too perfumey for me. I'll stick to Twinings Earl Grey."

126593,B001EUG65I,1.0,This is not worth it.  My pit ate it in large chunks in under a minute.  i bought it locally for what i'd pay for dinner- not worth it in terms of money or time in keeping him busy.  he takes longer to eat an entire bowl of food..

These bars are not exactly low calorie, though, in the writeup I read on the internet I , the guy who created the product says he sometimes eats a couple  of them for lunch. That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories. So much better for you than a candy bar. I read an interview the magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try other bars also, where they are selling them everywhere . I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this one, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did."
152441,B000OQ4A3S,3.0,"I was shocked how quickly this product came. I saw these on Dr. Oz and wanted to give them a try for a chocolate snack to cure my cravings for sweets.

The seller's service was great, but I don't know that I will order these again due to the taste."
237184,B000EDM772,2.0,"We bought a new bread machine to use this mix. Threw out the old one years ago. I gave this bread a bad review after the 1st loaf. Just made the 4th batch, and this bread is worth at least three and a half stars. Here's what we've learned: All ingredients must be at room temperature. The water and milk should be a bit warmer. Follow the directions carefully. It'll actually smell like you're baking bread in the last hour of the process. On second taste, the bread is pretty good. Most bread depends on what you put on it, and this bread is no different. I like the whipped peanut spread. Another favorite: spreadable butter with cinnamon and a sweetener. I'm coming back for a 2nd order. I'm a bread person, and this fits the bill."

I read on the news this week where a lady just died from rat urine being deposited on a soda can and it just made me cringe...we did not drink it out of the can as we never do...but my main concern is ..why would they ship out a product in that condition???? The juice wasnt horrible but it was unhygenic. I was disappointed.

Now for some people they like lemon in their tea, but I don't like lemon at all.

Sadly, the Lazy Day Dark Chocolate Ginger Cookies don't clear this hurdle for me, though in fairness I'm not gluten intolerant, and these cookies may be ideal for someone who is.<br /><br />Like another reviewer noted, the cookies don't fare well in a hot mailbox (which isn't their fault, but did result in the cookies being welded together by melted chocolate). The cookies have a somewhat soft and chewy texture, and each has a half-dip of dark chocolate. Unfortunately, there's not enough ginger in these cookies for me to have identified them as ""ginger"" in any way without the label. Overall, the impressions I got were simply ""soft and sweet"" - and, in fact, TOO sweet.<br /><br />Considering their rather steep price, I'd pass on these in the future...though as I said, if it's really hard to find gluten-free cookies these might be worthwhile for someone who has more restricted dietary choices than I do."

158717,B001189I3A,3.0,I'm disapointed because it didn't work on the under eye puffiness. But that could be because of an illness I have. I retain extra fluid under my eyes. It may work for others. It goes on nicely and is not greasy or heavy feeling. It's always good to put some kind of eye cream under your eyes for protection of the elements around us. That's why I only gave it a 3 star rating.

The caramel flavor is my favorite, but the apple cinnamon isn't too bad either. They're good snacks and they're fairly healthy and they're good for your body and digestive system.<br /><br />To my horror, I see that they're sweetened with high fructose corn-syrup which is mighty disappointing. I'd think that the demographic type that's interested in eating rice cakes is also going to be the demographic type that's sophisticated enough to read labels and sophisticated enough to know that HFCS is a dirty word and an unhealthy sweetener.<br /><br />I wish these mega-monster corporations would go back to SUGAR and just add the 1/10th of a penny cost to the retail price. It'd be worth it to me and others, who struggle to keep their weight ""normal."""

And, I think the shipper knew that there was a problem, because the cardboard box containing the bubble-wrapped creamers had been put inside a slightly larger cardboard box in an attempt to contain the leakage.

The slight tang of fruity notes was very unique and simply delightful. Also - knowing that only the highest quality chocolate is made with enough cocoa butter to preclude the need for soy lecithin, I was impressed that your 70% Excellence bar was soy-free. Like many other Americans, I typically avoid soy for health reasons.<br /><br />However, your new version of the 70% Excellence bar is entirely a disappointment. Its bland flavor is not disagreeable but it certainly lacks the character of your previous recipe. And I see that the quality of ingredients has also been sacrificed - the 70% bar now contains soy lecithin. This chocolate no longer stands out from any other chocolate available on store shelves.<br /><br />I will now be buying my chocolate from a different company. But if at some future time you decide to resume your previous version of the 70% Excellence bar, I will be pleased to buy from Lindt again."

If you don't have Prime, it's well worth it for us.<br /><br />The quality of these sunflower kernels is outstanding! Fresh,a bit sweet touch of salt not coated like some honey roasted peanuts tend to be. Very refreshing and a healthy addition to your diet.<br /><br />These are produced in New Hope, MN. Right in the heart of the Midwest. I'm sure from farm fields around the area. Great to see a health snack made right here from local sources.<br /><br />Give these a try. I'm sure you will enjoy them as much as my bride and I.<br /><br />Update: The price has gone up from 16.98/12 and found they are selling for 1.00 at Menard's up here in the midwest. Walmart was at 1.68 ea. Great product but might want to shop around for the best price. Prime is a good deal if the price is fair. Over 20.00/12 seems bit too high for me."

However, it is always challenging to insure that their products are fresh because Mauna Loa still insists on placing cryptic embossed alphanumeric codes on the bottom of each can which makes it nearly impossible to insure you are receiving fresh product (despite Mauna Loa's insistence to the contrary). I would contact Mauna Loa (now owned by Hershey Foods), register your vote for making an easy to read ""fresh through"" or better still, ""Produced on"" date MANDATORY for all food products. While on the phone, ask them to decipher your can codes and provide you with a code deciphering"" sheet until they do the right thing. You can find their toll free number listed on each can or package they sell. These cans are nearly impossible to find on grocer's shelves in the U.S. mainland,due to shelf space limitations and competitive slotting fees in the supermarkets. Nevertheless, they are still in my opinion, the best quality macadamia nuts on the market if you are a nut aficionado like myself.

I forced myself to eat most of the can because I didn't want to waste them, I tried eating them with bland crackers thinking that might make the saltiness less but still pretty salty.

Since I have one of the Keurig inserts for brewing your own grounds, it's a matter of opening the BBR package and dumping in the contents.  The coffe has that strong taste to it that reminds me of coffe thats been brewing all day.  Similar to Coffee People Jet Fuel, I'd choose this over Jet Fuel if it weren't for the packaging issues.<br /><br />Fix the issues and the review would be a 4."

79869,B00153SSY6,4.0,"The first bag, all three of my cats gobbled up.  However, my oldest cat started losing his fur and turned his nose up at the second bag.  I don't think there was anything wrong with the food.  The other two were still happy.  He's just getting older.  So while I still had enough to easily transition them, I went back to a completely grainfree food."
134034,B0024NXVZW,1.0,"I used to drink this tea every day. It was refreshing, left no after taste and doesn't taste like a diet drink. Well, they did something a certain soda company did and changed the formula. It's absolutely horrid now. After twenty minutes the after taste is<br />Still lingering and it gave me a headache! Right now only the hourglass and spiral shaped bottles contain the new flavor. Avoid them at all costs!"

I may, however, have to switch to automatic coffee delivery because we use so many k-cups. Love 'em..."
80798,B003DMXDGA,4.0,"These cheese curls taste much better that biscuit company variety, being a much more enjoyable, cheesier experience.  They are preservative, guilt free, low in saturated fat, and a rather nice expiration period, so you don't have to worry much about gorging on them before they expire."

133582,B002C58RME,1.0,I ordered this coffee based on the other reviews.  All three bags were rancid with quite a sour aftertaste.  Whichever community that spawned this coffee can keep it.  Please pass on this unless you are angry at your mouth and want revenge.
17294,B000EVIDUY,5.0,"The best gluten free brownie mix I have found.  Makes soft, chewy brownies.  The entire family loves them, even my teenager.  I made them and sent them to my celiac and non-celiac kids in the service.  Noone could tell the difference from the regular ones I use to make."
75604,B0050JL44W,4.0,"Renal diet foods tend to be really dry and my cat won't eat them. This food is different. It's got lots of moisture and apparently decent taste, since my kitty eats it up! And getting a renal kitty to eat is SO important!"

159645,B000V9EIIU,3.0,"I love Nips coffee candy - since I need to cut down on sugar, I ordered these. They do not taste like the regular Nips coffee candy, but they are still good tasting. The batch I got was melted and had run out of the wrapper. The pieces are all stuck together, so you could definitely not put a bunch of them in your purse or stick them in a pocket like I like to do. The 3 rating is because of the mess, not the candy. I recently bought some Woerther's sugarless coffee candy to carry in my purse, cause I have to eat the Nips candy when I'm at home and can wash them off my hands - they make a mess.<br /><br />They are sweetened with Maltitol, not Sucralose."
157270,B0019QT66I,3.0,"Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me."
161683,B004B9HZKY,3.0,I never got the wow factor with the dog food tht I was expecting. Currently my lab and border collie are on Nutro sensative stomach. I fine it is just as good if not better than Nutrisca. For the price Nutro is slightly cheaper but is much easier to find. My local pet supply carries Nutro. I haven't yet found a local supplier for Nutrisca. Didn't see any sort of improvement with the food and it didn't seem like the dogs were all that interested in it. They ate it but it sat around alot longer before they dove in.
136092,B005SPQENY,1.0,"I've tasted green tea infusions before and they are usually quite tasty Chantea is not tasty, infact it is too sweet, has an aftertaste, tasted like canned artificial lycees, plus acted like a fast laxative.  I originally come from the tropics so I definitely know how good, fresh passion fruit tastes like and there is no such taste in this drink.  The aloe and green tea flavors are not even noticeable because of the overwhelming sugar taste.  Most of the drink was poured down the sink.<br />Final verdict: I would not drink this again."
161093,B000E1694G,3.0,"I like these soups because they are filling, tasty, convenient, and sometimes cheaper to buy through Amazon. I send them to my daughter so she has a quick work lunch, and now her son liikes them as an after school snack. The sodium is a bit high but much better than other instant noodles.<br /><br />Also good for earthquake and emergency kits, though they need some water to rehydrate."
156046,B000TQBEFK,3.0,"I am in the OWL phase of Atkins (Ongoing Weight Loss)and started missing Greek Yogurt with honey, thought this would be great to put on my Oikos yogurt.  After reading a good review from another customer who used it for this exact purpose I thought I could not go wrong, but boy I sure did.  I really don't understand how anyone can say this tastes like honey!  I know I have been sugar-deprived for about 3 months now but this has ABSOLUTELY no honey flavor to me at all.  It is sweet and syrupy but doesn't have any taste whatsoever.  So if you are doing low-carb and craving a honey flavor, pass this one up.  If you just want something sweet on your toast or in your yogurt, save your $$ and use the sugar-free pancake syrup, at least it has an actual flavor.  I will wait until I am in maintenance phase & go back to the real honey, just use less."
235705,B002EYESYO,2.0,"As warned by other reviews, I received the WRONG product! Thank goodness i dont mind the coffee chocolate flavor too much, but i had tried the raspberry, preferred it, and ORDERED it! If this was a restaurant i'd get an apology from the waiter and my dish would very likely be complimentary considering i'd eat after my friends' food would be done (or COLD!)."
131035,B0002L3BYE,1.0,"This stuff tastes like glue.  There is no hint of marshmallow flavor in it at all. I am a person who never eats packaged or processed foods so my taste buds are different from when I was eating packaged things regularly in the past, now I can actually taste individual ingredients in foods like salt, pepper, spices. So, to me, this tasted like licking the bottom of a shoe or eating glue.  Full of chemicals, no food taste to it at all.  Now a year ago when I regularly ate processed foods my taste buds probably would have found this to not be so nasty..."
125952,B001IZM81A,1.0,"After reading the reviews, I ordered this extract.  I now have 3 bottles of almond extract that has absolutely no taste whatsoever!<br /><br />While it does smell like almond extract in the bottle, there is no flavor at all when added to my recipes.<br /><br />I've tried using lots more than the required amounts and still nothing.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item."

236586,B008YA1NWC,2.0,"I was sure I'd LOVE this coffee, but the coconut taste is very artificial and overwhelming...I was so disappointed.  I will take the Hazelnut GM Coffee over this any day.  It does smell good while brewing :)"
164322,B002915VF2,3.0,I found that the dessert had little flavor to it; I didn't taste any peanut butter and the chocolate was mild.  The most satisfying things about it are the minimal number of calories in the entire carton and that it seemed to curb my craving for real ice cream.
240909,B000NBQUNW,2.0,"My doctor wants me on statins but I think the possible side effects are<br />worse than the cholesterol the drugs treat.  These chews sound like a great idea.  The taste is ok - not great but ok.  However, the texture is yucky.  One reviewer said waxy but to me it's more like slimey and the slimey feeling stays after the chew is gone.  I've only had a few so far<br />and I really don't know if I can make it through the bag much less order them again.  The chews may lower cholesterol but only if you can tolerate them and I don't think I'll be able to do that.  I think the company needs to rework the formula.  It's back to the drawing board for me.<br />Amazon's service was great (as it usually is).  They came fast and in perfect condition so it's only the product that I'm complaining about.<br />I just had another one and actually I'm not too happy with the taste either."
79037,B003V33YU6,4.0,"Considering I ordered this mistakenly thinking it was whole-bean (thanks to my erroneously trusting Amazon's less-than-stellar search engine), this coffee, as all the other whole-bean coffees I've ordered from this roaster) is more than satisfactory, but less than great."
17422,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"I got this as a sample with my new Mr. Coffee keurig machine.  I usually only drink one cup here and there fairly inconsistently and I am absolutely loving how k-cups work.  That being said, this k-cup made the best coffee I have ever had, hands down.  It isn't bitter at all and has a nice bold flavor that sends a warmth of delight radiating out from your taste buds. It seems a bit bold for a medium roast, so keep that in mind. It does say ""extra bold/very intense"" on the cup after all.  However, it is perfect for someone who enjoys a strong and fairly intense cup. I will continue to try other k-cups but I have a feeling this will become my staple, go-to brand for some time to come.  I always liked coffee but would not consider myself a ""coffee lover"".  Between this cup and my new machine to brew it with, I'm definitely heading in that direction.  Try some!"

125690,B004B44ZQ6,1.0,"Although our dog loved the taste of these bully sticks, they smelled to high heaven.  I know that bully sticks aren't supposed to smell like roses, but these things were the worst!  It smelled like the worst case of foot funk ever.  I thought that maybe if I aired them out it would be better, but that did not help.  Our dog was so excited to have this treat, but in the end, we threw them all away because we couldn't handle the odor any longer."
18042,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,This product is an excellent addition to my morning protein shakes. I have used this product every morning for the last 45 days in my chocolate high protein shake to give it a Peanut Butter Chocolate Treat to it. Sometimes when I am craving a nighttime sweet dessert I use chocolate protein with the PB2 to create an amazing dessert to curb my cravings. This works great especially for those watching what you eat and trying to lose weight.
168506,B0001ES9F8,3.0,"Huge Senseo coffee fan, but this flavor doesn't really hit the mark. It's nice, but in small doses. Dark Roast is probably the best out of all the selections they have."

241634,B0081XPTBS,2.0,"I bought this formula thinking I'm buying the best for my 8 month old. Even though this wasn't available in the smaller 8oz size which I would have prefered to ensure that my son liked it, I went ahead and bought it since he's not a fussy baby and easily took Similac and Enfamil earlier.<br /><br />I used formula only to supplement breastfeeding and gave about 2-4oz of this daily to my son for 4-5 days. During this time, we noticed that he was very cranky and didn't slepe well, would scream even in his sleep and keep curling up and rolling in bed, sort of banging his face and head on the mattress. I attributed this to teething or constipation. But when over the weekend I did not supplement at all, he was completely fine. Then to test, I gave it to him again after he had been fine for a couple of days and had also pooped well. Even after just 2 oz in the afternoon, he started doing the same thing...screaming, rolling in bed, unable to sleep well.<br /><br />I also read that there is an issue with the way the DHA is obtained, using some toxic chemical, when researching this formula to find if other mom's had seen the same issue with their children. I give it a 2 rating as I don't know if it just didn't suit my child or if there is something not good in the formula."
76778,B0049ULB78,4.0,I liked all the K-cup coffees.  This one was strong/dark but was not overly bitter.  I used it with the travel mug setting on the coffee maker and it was just right.
82605,B000FA15D6,4.0,"My kids LOVE these things. They are so convenient too.  I really like to order from Amazon, because it is so convenient... but watch the price on these little babies. I originally bought these in Sept 2011 for under seven dollars. 2 months later the price is over 14. Really?! I can appreciate inflation, but this kind of price increase is robbery!"
128643,B001EQ55Y0,1.0,"These almonds aren't actually smoked. It's too bad that they are allowed to call them ""Smoked Almonds"" when the almonds have never been near any smoke and the flavor comes out of a bottle."

17418,B0045Z6K50,5.0,"Of all the K-cups I have tried....this is the very best.  Never bitter and always strong enough for the good bold flavor to come thru. I've tried others that were listed as Bold, but they lacked depth and had a bitterness to them. SO,  for me it's Newman special blend all the way!"
243703,B000SAPXGS,2.0,"I'm not a fan. The bag I received had little to no mint flavor. It has mild tannins associated with green tea, but the flavor is unimpressive. I was hoping for more of a mint flavor, but I don't get it with this tea. The bag smells quite minty, however.<br /><br />I purchased a bag of the Davidson's Rooibos and that is very tasty. Perhaps this tea just isn't for me?"
240580,B00113ZZ5U,2.0,"Too grainy and not a distinct coconut flavor. I was expecting a coconut milk consistency for frozen deserts, coffee and soups. Too much oil in this product to use in coffee and too grainy for soups and deserts.  It may be good for baking, but I haven't tried that as yet. I do like the fact that it is condensed and you add water to it, good packaging."
17791,B000EVMNO6,5.0,these are the best things in the world.  my family and i love love love them.
168607,B0001ES9F8,3.0,"I'm a fan of Hazlenut creamer in my coffee, but if you are expecting the same taste with this coffee, like I was, you will be disappointed. It tastes like weak regular coffee with only a faint hint of hazlenut. I also purchased French Vanilla and had the same reaction.  I still had to add my creamer. I really like the Senseo coffee (I use it with my Hamilton Beach single cup maker) but I don't think I will buy the flavored anymore. I will stick with the regular and add my creamer."
124884,B005BHIESC,1.0,I tried two different flavors of Vita CoCo Coconut water both had a plastic taste that i didn't like.When one arrived it had the plastic cap broken off but it still had the foil seal so i felt safe drinking it.Glad i just tried  one of each flavor.
165976,B002JLT5D6,3.0,"I like soynuts. I think these would be better to snack on if they weren't so dry. So not sure<br />exactly their process. I will say, I put them in my cereal, and with the milk and other things I add,<br />they are fine."
240201,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"I have a 1.5 -year-old, 60-pound Boxer/Pitt Mix she loved the food; gobbled it right up.  However, I then did some additional research online and was surprised to discover that this dog food probably isn't the most healthy nor nutritious thing to feed my Joy-Joy.  Since the main source of protein comes from chicken by product; basically what's left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.<br /><br />I think we will stick with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZ1BNE"">Blue Buffalo Large Breed Puppy Dry Food, Chicken and Rice Recipe, 30-Pound Bag</a>.  Joy-Joy loves the favor and it is what my vet recommended."
127396,B005VOONKI,1.0,"My husband has one of the Hamilton Beach One Cup Coffee makers that uses Senseo pods.  So when I saw this coffee came in pods, I decided to try it since I haven't found any other competitors for Senseo.  Unfortunately, this was just bad.  When I opened the pouch, it smelled bitter.  When he brewed a cup, it smelled and tasted burnt.  It wasn't weak, as some other reviewers have stated, but it tasted so bad he poured the rest of thecup down the drain.<br /><br />Obviously, any food item is a matter of individual taste.  However, this smelled bad to me (a non-coffee drinker who loves the smell of brewing coffee), and even flavored creamer couldn't make it palatable for my husband. The price is reasonable, but I just can't recommend it."
250479,B004WSBZAA,2.0,"The packaging claims that the 150g jar of powder is a 30-60 day supply; however, for my 40-pound dog it only lasted 10 days. This is partly because the packaging instructs you to double the dose for the first 4-6 weeks; however, even if I had not been doubling the dose it would only have last 20 days -- and it's supposed to be used on dogs more than twice my dog's size. If you have a dog over 75 pounds and want to double the dose as recommended, you'll be through with the jar in five days!<br /><br />In the little time before the jar ran out I did not notice any difference in my dog's joint discomfort.<br /><br />On the plus side, I suppose, there's the fact that she really loved the taste."
17526,B0045Z6K50,5.0,Great price and delicious coffee. Fits the needs of all our family members.  This is one of our family's favorite coffees.
151062,B003EGUA20,3.0,"I have never purchased tart cherries before. I was elated to find them on the Internet.

Had I known this from the discription, I would not have purchased them."
157824,B001872UCA,3.0,"Healthy Choice is my favorite soup and this is one of my favorite varieties.  I just haven't been able to find it anywhere in Texas since I moved here.  In fact, lately I haven't been able to find any of the 15-ounce cans, preferred over the larger soup cans from other brands, anywhere lately.  Only the overpriced microwaveable bowls.  One of my bosses likes their chicken soup and has cans, so I'm guessing at least that is available at a club store he frequents, but your average grocery chain appears to have phased it out.  But I digress.<br /><br />This variety is very tasty.  It's a hearty soup made with navy beans and a smattering of pinto beans for color I guess.  It also includes carrots, celery, and potato, along with a respectable amount of (chopped and formed) ham dices.  So, I can't wait for a sale and use coupons, but at least I can get it from Amazon at a pretty fair price.<br /><br />My only criticism is the condition in which it arrived.  (See photo)  The 12 cans are packed in a cardboard flat sealed with plastic, and *every* can was dented, four of them severely to the extent I am not sure they're safe to eat.  One I didn't even think I *could* open, but managed it with a special can opener that cuts along the outside of the rim.  (I still was afraid to eat it.) I might understand cans on the outer edge getting dented on one side or the other, but all of them?  It makes me suspicious that their stock are ""scratch and dents"" from the manufacturer.  Amazon has been kind enough to offer replacements, and I will provide an update if I find the same to be true of the next case.  Either way, the food bank will benefit from several cans.  I like this soup--a lot--just not 24 cans worth.<br /><br />UPDATED -- Just received the replacements.  This shipment also had some significantly dented cans.  (See photo)  Again, all of them had a dent somewhere, mostly minor, and I wonder if they buy ""seconds"" from the manufacturer of cans that crashed off the assembly line.  It's that, or their warehouse people are not even remotely taking ordinary care.  As excited as I was initially to be able to buy my favorite soup from Amazon, I don't think I'll risk it again.  I'll have to come up with another solution."
248670,B000E682NW,2.0,"This tea definitely smelled like blueberries but upon tasting it, it was a very sour /bitter taste to me despite not over steeping the tea. It almost tasted like cough syrup. added a bit of organic sugar and it tasted a bit better. Maybe I Just don't like herbal / fruit flavored teas."
250990,B0002HOEWQ,2.0,"I am sure it's a nice honey. But, I could not enjoy it because, the package found completely damaged when it was just arrived."
77746,B001LG940E,4.0,"I really like carbonated beverages.  And I really like juice.  This beverage brings together the two without adding a bunch of sugar or syrup.<br /><br />I found my can waiting for me when I arrived home from work with a bag of Chinese Food.  I usually have C*ke with with my Egg Roll etc but decided to try something different.<br /><br />The carbonation is light and goes away if you take too long to drink it.  But at 8.3 ounces I was pretty close to done before I noticed it.<br /><br />The taste was light but distinctly black cherry.  I gave my younger son some to get his opinion.  He said it was good.  He usually drinks Sprite.  He also likes some of the flavored sparkling water and said that he likes this better.  He also likes a lot of juice and prefers it to this because the ""fizz"" took away the ""juice"" taste.<br /><br />Overall we both liked it and would drink it again - definitely one of the better beverages of this type we've tasted!"
81874,B005CUU25G,4.0,"This is the most unique dog treat I've seen. The liquid treat is dispensed from a container that reminds me of a large lip gloss tube with a roller. I've given this unique dog treat ""4 stars"" instead of five as an average based on the varied reactions from my two small dogs. The smaller Malti-poo loved the treat and from his reaction would give it ""5 stars"". He immediately licked the roller, received the treat, and wanted more. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a pickier eater in general and wouldn't even try it at first. He finally did, but didn't seem to like it. We have the chicken flavor and it may be he just didn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Since our Malti-poo likes it so much, I have just ordered the three-pack that has chicken, liver, and bacon flavors. The three-pack is a better value than the individual packs and I'm hoping our Cavalier will like one of the other flavors better than the chicken. This is a unique idea to reward dogs with a treat without filling them up like traditional dog treats.<br /><br />** Update:  I ordered the three-pack and my Cavalier definitely likes the bacon flavor much better than chicken!"
237017,B0001AV4QS,2.0,"Very disappointed that it did not come in the tin as shown in the photo, instead the espresso came in a cardboard box. I bought it mainly for the tin to reuse for coffee. I will not buy from this seller again as very misleading with the picture!!"

162035,B002912506,3.0,"I love the Chocolate Mint and Peanut butter flavors, but this flavor tasted like vanilla whey.  It was not bad tasting, but I drink enough whey and have experimented with various whey ice cream recipes and this reminded mea bit of some of the concoctions I have made and for the price, it just wasn't that special of a treat.  I won't buy this flavor again, but I do enjoy choc. mint and choc peanut butter a lot (which is unusually because I normally don't like chocolate ice cream)."
154072,B001EQ4GZ4,3.0,The nuts arrived. I don't know how. The box was completely open at the top and the bottom was falling apart. The box was damp and it looked like the tape which was to hold the two panels of the top had not been put on very well. I'm not sure if tis review is going to reach anyone. I tried to find a site I could click on to make this comment but was not successful.
160750,B001BOQ3SW,3.0,"I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.<br /><br />My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine."
75638,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"Let me just say this stuff gives you what you want in an energy drink. While not the very best tasting energy drink on the market, I don't think any other drink give you a kick in the behind like this one does & to be absolutely truthful, taste is not what you buy these for. If you need a jump start pick one of these bad boys up & hold on! Most highly recommended!"

I disregarded the 1 star review about the candy melting and stuff, hoping it was a one time thing.<br />Well when i received my candy, it was melted together in several blocks. It seems the candys broke and the heat made them combine  into big chunks.<br /><br />I wish they wernt in such big chunks, but they were still good."

241754,B0081XPTBS,2.0,"For 4 days at the hospital, our son had Enfamil. We went home and switched him to this Earth's Best Organic. He started fussing and crying all day long. Two days later, we switched him back to the non-organic Enfamil and he was fine again.<br /><br />At 1 month old, we tried Earth's Best Organic again. Same problem. Baby starts crying soon after feeding with or without Mylicon so we went back to Enfamil again.<br /><br />We have 3 more Earth's best cans sitting there for now. They won't expire soon since they're not opened yet.<br />Baby is almost three months now and we'll try again later cause we do want him to get the Organic stuff. Perhaps his digestive system will develop some more and in a few more months, he can do the organic again.<br /><br />I wonder if Enfamil has some addictive stuff in it or, if there's something in Earth's best that just does not agree with our son."
76995,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I'm a big proponent of eating chocolate for breakfast...or any other time.  Let's face it, chocolate is sooo delicious and has some health benefits too.  It's a mystery why there aren't more chocolate filled breakfast cereals.  Well thankfully, Back to Nature Chocolate Delights Granola fits the bill to a T, whatever that means.<br /><br />This cereal has the exact balance of granola, chocolate and sugar that I've always dreamed of.  Plus, you won't find any yucky corn syrup.  The ingredients are all top notch (though I would have preferred more molasses and less evaporated cane sugar).  The chocolate chunks are outstanding.  They are the perfect shape and size and melt in your mouth, not in the bowl.  This is the first chocolate cereals I've seen that doesn't turn your milk brown!  I was blown away.<br /><br />As I said, the cereal is balanced, so it's not too sweet for breakfast.  It will likely appeal to the more refined adult chocolate lover as well as any kid.  I had only two gripes - (1) the granola is a little too loose with little pieces to eat easily straight out of the bag.  (2) it has a moderate to high sog factor when left in milk."

16814,B001LGGH40,5.0,"I seldom drink carbonated beverages, but tried the Kiwi Berry since it sounded interesting and had no added sweeteners or preservatives.<br /><br />I was sure surprised by the very light carbonation, which I enjoyed, plus the taste was really, really good.  It is not too sweet and has a very nice, fruity taste.  I more or less expected something along the lines of a flavored  Pepsi or a Coke.<br /><br />I think the size of the can is just right for me.  I would not want something larger.  I believe it has a few more calories than a Coke, but the flavor is very refreshing and if I had my choice, I would drink the Switch drinks especially the Kiwi Berry."

81788,B005CUU25G,4.0,"The dogs like the Lickety Stiks, no question about it.  After one brief attempt to just bite it, the 3-year-old settled in to licking, and the the 11-year-old understood the idea from the start (to be fair, they are both experienced with the concept of licking ice cream and the 'lick it!' reminder may have helped).  I am sure if the Stiks were left in reach, they would quickly chew into them and make a mess, so that's something of which to be careful. They did not drip when held upside down, which was pleasing.<br /><br />I am fortunate that neither of our dogs are overweight or have weight concerns; owners with chubby dogs expressed extensive enthusiasm when I asked them about the Stiks.  The younger dog is not a huge treat hound -- he can often 'take it or leave it,' and these proved no different.  I keep hoping to find the motivator that he just can't walk away from.  The Stiks didn't prove to be his Achilles heel but they are in excellent company in that regard -- both dogs clearly found them palatable and enjoyable.<br /><br />My primary use of treats is in training, and my main quibble with the Stiks is that it is hard to use them to lure... you know how you have a treat in your hand and you allow the dog to nose it but not take it while you lure them?  You can't really do that with these.  They also wouldn't be good when set on a target, as a chunk of bait is. Also, the licks of the rollerball take time, while a small, soft chunk of cheese or liver can be gulped down without any noticeable delay in the action.<br /><br />I found all three 'flavors' to be rather unpleasantly smelly -- I think the manufacturer could maybe dial back the scent and still have plenty of appeal to the dogs.  They were also kind of sticky and did leave a smear if one accidentally brushed the roller-ball dispenser across any surfaces while wielding it.  Our newest vehicle has terribly inappropriate light-colored upholstery (what were we thinking?) and the commercials for the Stiks that talk about keeping one in the car made me cringe -- I would not want these anywhere near light-colored textiles!<br /><br />I'm glad to have tried these but I don't know that I will make a point to purchase them in the future, especially at the current price point."

157142,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"Bag is tightly vacuum packed in a sturdy plastic/aluminum pouch.  It has a strand of aluminum wire so you reseal its top every time you use it.  Important, as coffee looses much of its aroma and freshness when not properly sealed. I also regularly replace it back to the refrigerator once opened.<br /><br />This coffee is good, but not exciting enough.  The flavor is somewhat a little bland. The aroma likewise does not have a strong punch to it.  I do like the hazel flavor coffee, but the taste here is very subtle."
248213,B0047YVKFY,2.0,"I bought this wanting something comparable to the Curdelious brand I bought in Lancaster County, PA or the Tiptree brand found here on Amazon.  Based on the previous review, I thought it would be something worthwhile to try this brand too.  After one taste, I have thrown out the bottle and plan to donate the remaining 2 sold in this multi-pack to charity.  It has no flavor at all.  Not worth the price.  Save your money and go with the Tiptree brand."

With other rice blends it takes so long to rinse that sometimes it's not even worth the effort for little reward.  This rice has it all...flavor, texture and no rinsing.  A lazy cooks dream."

In terms of ""net carbs"" this means while the nutritional information on the Amazon website suggests a serving has 11 grams net carbs, in fact a serving has 18 grams net carbs, an increase of more than 60 percent over what the website indicates.<br /><br />I haven't tasted the stuff nor will I so my rating is not based on the taste of the product.

240057,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"The triumph of marketing and finance over science and medicine is the theme of this ersatz dog food.  Have you ever seen a better dressed bag of dog food?  Snow White background with high tone graphics of floating ears of corn and amber grain just waving at you.<br /><br />Then, they were smart enough to have a really good reseal mechanism to open and close without a care.  No squeezing or stretching, struggling with those insane tracks you press together, sort of.  Beautiful.<br /><br />Open the bag and it is a riot of colors.  Better than anything Post or Kellogg can dish out.  And the doggie looks like the Quaker Oats guy.  This is genius.<br /><br />Smells like a bag of jumbo Fritos.  My 14 1/2 year old Corgi came sailing over my shoulder like a linebacker.  Okay girl, what do you think of this?  A cup and a half was gone quicker than you can say chicken by-product meal.  Say what? No, not chicken.  Just the by-product, made into ""meal"".  And that is only second in proportion.  The first is corn meal.  Third is corn gluten meal.  Then comes the wheat flour, followed by preserved animal fat.<br /><br />Why do we feed cattle corn?  Okay, yes, I know it is highly subsidized by tax dollars.  Besides that?  It makes them cows nice and fat on the cheap.  And what do Cattle produce, anybody?  Right, methane.  And now so does my dog.  There is probably no connection.  It might not even be mentioned in the other reviews; but please do not go by my review alone.  Excuse me while I open the window.  Maybe not quite enough calcium carbonate.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is propylene glycol and sugar both.  Yes that was the stuff added to Austrian dessert wine to make it sweet until they were caught.  You only see it in anti-freeze now (not to be confused with the more common ethylene) because the FDA has banned it in cat food.

157421,B0019QT66I,3.0,"I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep at night, and I have suffered from migraines for most of my life. This product seemed like the perfect solution to both problems.<br /><br />For the sleep issue, I have never found anything that even comes close. I actually fell asleep, shortly after going to bed, with ease. This was really an incredible change for the better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I discovered that my migraines got worse when I was taking this. Not just a little bit worse, MUCH worse. It was as if the worst part of the migraine got extended much longer than normal. It was to the point that I had to be driven home from work and ended up in the ER in one case while I was taking this (the normal dose recommended on the label). This was the first and only time I have ever been to the ER for a migraine in 20+ years of getting migraines.<br /><br />Even after that incident I really wanted to continue at least with a small dose before bed. I tried this on and off for several weeks, but unfortunately it consistently aggravated my headaches the next day anytime I took it.<br /><br />I've noticed other forms of Magnesium also cause headache issues for me, which is odd since it is supposed to help prevent them. So, hopefully this reaction is fairly individual to me. But the lack of much of any negative reviews for this product compelled me to write a review. Evidently, not everybody reacts well to it (but I do really, really wish I could take it for the sleep benefit.)"
157265,B004IJMVRE,3.0,"If you plan on eating this as a cereal I have a one-word review: don't. It's bad - the apple and spice taste does not come through in a pleasant way. Alpen makes some good cereals, but this is not one of them.<br /><br />But it is pretty good for baking. I've used it in breads and cookies, and in both cases it worked very well. The apple taste works much better when combined with other ingredients. Basically, it's a replacement for recipes that call for rolled oats. As such, it adds better flavor and texture than just plain oats.<br /><br />The downside is that the caloric content is pretty high. A one cup serving has 210 calories, 30 of which are from fat. But, the fiber content is good, and it also has a decent amount of protein from the soy and is very low in sodium. The nutrition info is as follows:<br /><br />Serving size = 1 cup<br />Calories = 210<br />Calories from fat = 30<br />Total fat = 3.5g (5%)<br />Saturated fat = 0.5g (3%)<br />No trans fat<br />No cholesterol<br />Sodium = 15mg (1%)<br />Potassium = 230mg (7%)<br />Total carb 38g (13%)<br />Fiber 7g (28%) (2g soluble, 5g insoluble)<br />Sugar 8g<br />Protein 8g (13%)<br /><br />MDR: 0% for vitamin A, C; 6% calcium, 10% iron, 15% phosphorus, 15% magnesium, 8% zinc<br /><br />Top ingredients: whole wheat, whole grain barley, rolled whole oat flakes, toasted soy nuggets, brown sugar, dehydrated apples, flax seed, dehydrated yogurt, [plus various flavorings]<br /><br />So, as a cereal 1 star.

While this Smokehouse product has similar pricing to bully sticks, they simply aren't bully sticks.  They aren't long lasting at all.  Because of the high price of these beefy sticks and they're more of a quickly consumed treat rather than a long lasting chew, I took 2 stars off the rating.<br /><br />My 30 lbs sheltie girl ate hers in less than 3 minutes and she's a lady-like eater, not a gulper.  But both shelties of mine do enjoy these beefy sticks greatly, so it gets 3 stars for what it is, a treat or a very quick chew.  I just won't buy them again.  True bully sticks are the way to go if you want something that will occupy your furry chewer's time.  A really thick bully (I buy the full 36"" bully canes, otherwise known as ""walking sticks"") will take my kids nearly 2 hours of steady chewing to get a few inches off of it.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a quick chew that's rather expensive, these Smokehouse beefy sticks are just that."

I don't think I will buy it because it really is not a healthy treat for her but since she likes it and it does not make a mess I gave it 4 stars.

Good fragrance/bouquet--flowery.<br />Steeped 1 tsp in boiling hot water -- large cup; the result was a heavy dark brew -- like coffee. Not the light golden brew of a good FOP Assamese. The liquor heavily tainted the inside of the cups with a dark film residue. Taste slightly corky.<br />Tried 1/2 tsp and later a large pinch. Same dark  brew and film residues.<br />The product appears to heavily doctored/colored and not organic or tippy FOP as claimed. Disappointing.

16572,B000RJARJS,5.0,"I think I can call myself a good Turkish Tea drinker. If you are not familiar with any of these teas, choose the cheapest one, which is the Yellow box (Turist) in general. It will give you 80-90% the same taste. The pink/red box (Filiz) is supposed to be the next better one, while it is the most favorite choice for many Turkish tea lowers. The red box (Cay Cicegi) is presented as better and stronger than Filiz, and the black box (Altinbas) is best among these four tea types. However, the prices on Amazon.com are at least double of what you can find at your local ethnic food stores. See if you can find any local stores if possible. Once you find a local merchant, you will find more choices to buy with tea, like Turkish delight, baklava, halva, Turkish cookies, white (feta) cheese, black/green olives, sudjook, and much more.

She would easily rate it 5 stars, but needless to say I have my own opinion.<br /><br />Being a bit of a chocolate granola snob, I have to compare the flavor and texture of this granola to that of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAMK5O"">KASHI COCOA BEACH GRANOLA</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZ9R3O"">Cascadian Farm Cereal, Dark Chocolate Almond, Organic, 13.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, my long-time favorite. I have enjoyed all three as both a snack and a meal, usually with milk.<br /><br />Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is more enjoyable than the Kashi as both a snack or as a meal. The flavor of the Kashi can be a bit too generic, and this granola just tastes healthier and more natural. As a snack, my only complaint is the amount of small bits that are hard to snack on. Perhaps my wife got all the large morsels before she let me have a taste, but I do feel there should be more uniformity for best enjoyment. This is not as important in a bowl, of course.<br /><br />I enjoyed a medium sized bowl with milk, but this is where the Cascadian Farms granola takes it a step further. I ALWAYS want a second bowl of Cascadian Farms because it just tastes so good, but here I didn't find myself going back for more. While this does lead me to rate this granola just below my personal favorite, it might be a positive point as others trying to lose weight (such as myself) are less likely to give in to the urge for ""just one more bowl""."
80378,B0009XPD64,4.0,"Great dog food.  My 2.5 year old lab is at a healthier weight after a year on this (she was 90 lbs as a 1.5 year old pup, and she's slimmed down to 80.  But she's a very large lab, so she wasn't really fat to begin with).  Also, I don't wanna get too graphic, but there is evidence on our walks that she's digesting this better than the grocery store food I used to give her.<br /><br />(I started her on this because we suspected a food allergy, and then I liked the results.)<br /><br />But why is it going up in price?  I've been buying it off Amazon because, with Prime, it's cost effective.  But it was $50 in February, $55 in March, and now $60 in April?  What gives??  I might have to start buying it at the brick-and-mortar store again.  And that's a shame, because having a month's worth of dog food delivered to your door is pretty awesome."
154642,B001ONPN40,3.0,"I ordered this product through Amazon and found that most of the crackers were broken up into pieces.  I don't know if this was because of poor handling during shipping or just a faulty batch.  The flavor was good although it got old after a couple boxes, but flavor is a subjective thing so you may or may not like it.  Another thing to note is that these are the 9 oz boxes, which are smaller than the normal box you are used to seeing.  I didn't notice that when ordering, so I thought I was getting a better deal than I actually was."

We highly reccomend Tennessee Red Lightning; it's just hot enough for those who like it hot!"
250300,B002S4TJ58,2.0,I didn't look closely enough at the price.  I thought sold in 10 packs meant 10 packages.  When I received 10 little marshmallows for $10 + $4.95 shipping and handling I was floored.  I have made homemade marshmallows and the contents don't cost very much.
77902,B001ELJK8C,4.0,"I have made a number of these kits and the Zin Blush is my least favorite but the wife likes it so I made it again. The price and ease of making these kits keep me buying them. Let these age six months or so and it makes a huge difference. I really like the Tuscany Rosso and the Muscato to blend 50/50 but the Muscato is no longer available. Will try the Barolo next. I have dedicated a 6 gallon carboy to these kits and have one working all the time. I also let the wine bulk age in the carboy for a few extra weeks. Maybe it helps, maybe it doesn't but I think it helps not to rush it to the bottle."
133356,B0090X8IPM,1.0,"... consistently bad.<br /><br />--- EDITED 11-27-2010 ---<br />Has anyone read the ingredients? This product contains corn maltodextrin (which I have an allergy to), vegetable glycerin, and Indian sarsaparilla root. This is probably where the odd and nasty taste I am getting is coming from.<br /><br />And why the hell are these in coffee? Shouldn't it be JUST coffee and whatever flavoring is added?<br /><br />Way to go Starbucks! 1 star!<br />--- EDIT ---<br /><br />I've tried many different Starbucks coffees, from morning blends to more flavored coffees and not one have I enjoyed or liked.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor in Starbucks Natural Fusions is a joke. When you first open the bag you are hit with this amazing aroma of nice fragrant coffee with a delightful hint of vanilla. When brewing, you completely loose the vanilla smell. And once tasted, the vanilla is GONE. And I don't think I should be expected to have to add something (be it milk, cream, or some other product) to bring out the flavor of the coffee. A good coffee can stand alone straight from the pot.<br /><br />No matter how weak or strong I made it, it had a not so pleasant taste to it. I'm thinking that it had a lot of quakers in it before the coffee was ground, thus this odd taste was present.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality is the look and design of the bag, initial smell, and the fact that it gives me my caffeine for the day, even if I have to chug it.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board Starbucks and come back with a better tasting blend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Smells great!<br />Didn't get a bitter taste from it (oddly enough).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Didn't taste like vanilla by any stretch.<br />Isn't all that palatable to my or three other peoples taste.<br />Pricey for mediocre coffee."

Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, acidic, or just ordinary. We have found OUR FAVORITE with this one. It's strong, flavorful, and smooth. Comes exactly as described by the seller, order promptly processed, arrives quickly. Can't beat it in our opinion. I can recommend this coffee and the seller with confidence."
76575,B0049ULB78,4.0,"This blend isn't too harsh though.  Admittedly I use creamer with all my coffee; but I find that this particular blend does well with me.  If I were to buy more Dark Roast in the future, it would probably be this one.  I'm a fan of most all Green Mountain Coffees."
16871,B001LGGH40,5.0,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is an excellent product that far exceeded my expectations.  I'm not a fan of the kiwi-strawberry combo that when attempted with artificial flavors comes of as borderline toxic, but The Switch succeeds where others fail, and without the need for artificial flavors or unnecessary additives.<br />I  had my doubts about this product, primarily because there are so many new ""craft"" sodas on the market.  These ""craft"" sodas seem to be the  non-alcoholic equivalent of the micro-brew craze that seems to be leveling off.<br />The fact that the product is actually fruit juice, gives me high-hopes that the corn syrup and chemically dependant soda industry can innovate with solid and natural products.<br />The small size is also a benefit, in that it's adequate for this type of beverage.  We've become a society of excess, and sodas, colas and other soft-drinks have not been immune,  The Switch brings us back to the days of reasonable and healthy serving sizes and hopefully consumers will take note.<br />An all-around excellent product that I will be looking for in stores."
165715,B0000D9N59,3.0,"I ordered a Spanish cheese selection with a 1/2 pound portion of this vendor's Strevecchia (spelling?) Parmigiano Reggiano.  I was able to sample the prodects sent and they were acceptable, for the most part.  However, the Parmigiano Reggiano, at $25 a pound, was disappointing.  It was largely rind and while the edible portion of the wedge was very good, I think I deserved better for the dear price.  Suggestion: Go to Sam's club and get PR there for lots less.  Their PR is very good indeed and you can see what you're getting.  the PR I ordered was like what I used to buy in Cambridge when I lived in the UK in the late 1990s.  it is aged about three years.  The standard PR offered here is not aged nearly as long and it does make a difference.  There is no bad PR- it's all wonderful, but some is just more wonderful.  If you aren't going for the more aged PRs, you're just as well off with a less costly Grana Padano, made the same way but not aged as long, and not name controlled as is Parmigianno Reggiano.

It was by far the worst K-Cup I have used. The coffee at the 7.5 ounce<br />setting came out like mudd.(Note: This K-Cup was not described as bold or Extra bold)I tried again at the 11.5 ounce setting; it tasted like cheap instant<br />coffee.

80912,B0029JW9JU,4.0,"Haven't bought this online, just at the supermarket.<br />It's good on homemade pizza. Thick slices are amazing. Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them ""raw"" and giving it a negative review.

152237,B004OVATO8,3.0,"I really like the taste and balanced nutrition & sugar amount in this product but the stickiness is rather a disappointment. Straight to the pros and cons of this fruit&nut bar:<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Tastes great; balanced sweet and savoury.<br />+ Right amount of nutrition, balanced sugar too. Less sweet compared to the typical energy bar.<br />+ Vegan and Gluten-free. Great choice if you have a special diet.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The 'syrup mix' that makes the nuts and berries stick together is very sticky. The wrapper tend to stick to the bar so it's not so easy to peel it open.<br />- I eat energy bar as quick breakfast or snack on the go. Having my lips and fingertips sticky after eating this isn't a nice feeling especially when there's no tissue/water around to wipe it off.<br /><br />If you don't mind the stickiness, this product is a great addition to your choice of healthier snack, for a healthier lifestyle."

Don't know if it's something i want to experience for a whole 24 hrs (bloating) just to suppress appetite. Read the label about this product containing Senna as one of the ingredients."

If money is no object, consider plugging Kona Coffee into Google, then select a seller and order Peaberry Kona. At about $17.00 for 8 oz its the most expensive available.

I know it sounds ironic to say that ""the flavor is not good and it also doesn't last long enough,"" but that's the essence.  You have a generic, sugary flavor that disappears after about 5 minutes.  After that, it's like chewing a piece of rubber."

They are expensive, though. And also, there are a very few pieces of a snack per each bag - maybe five or so. They are just larger than others on the market, and they are gone in seconds. My son immediately wants more, the amount is just not sufficient.<br />I will probably buy them again (for the ingredients), but I wish they were smaller in size and had more in the bag."

Loaded with cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts, they are simply a sticky and crunchy delight.

The sodium is low at 95 mg and the cholesterol is zero. This is one of those treats that your body needs, but because of the fat calories- not that often.

77119,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Taste: This is a fairly typical granola -- it's very sweet and crunchy, with good texture and taste. Although it's tasty, it didn't make me crave more, which might be a good thing for dieters.<br /><br />Nutrition: The ingredients include whole oats, chocolate, and a lot of different names for what is essentially sugar. A half cup of it contains 220 calories, with 20 calories from 5 grams of protein, about 150 calories from carbs (including 4 grams of dietary fiber, 13 grams of sugars, and 20 grams of other carbs), and 50 calories from 6 grams of fat (including 2 grams of saturated fat). All in all, it's a lot better than a candy bar, but obviously fruit and vegetables would always be a better health choice."
235386,B0028MO8EW,2.0,They taste like cardboard and vanilla air freshener. Not worth the price. I think that they were old when I received them.
234280,B000F4H5GS,2.0,I will be canceling my order as the taste is far too weak. I use two teabags per cup and the taste is just missing!?
82415,B0007IQQXA,4.0,I had some of the Green Mountain coffee and it was very acidic and way too strong so I wanted something with more flavor and I bought this one. I think it is a great coffee flavor. Those who say it has no flavor obviously are expecting something like a powdery flavored coffee. This isn't too sweet but sweet enough and has a great after taste unlike most coffee which is too acidic. If you are looking for a light roast coffee with a sweet hint of vanilla then get this for sure! can't wait to try other van houtte flavors!
81295,B0030VBSBG,4.0,"I first tried these with my twins when they were starting on solid food.  I figured they liked yogurt, so they'd probably like these.

77527,B002EYBB3A,4.0,"Overall, pleased with the product.  In particular, knowing it is lower in mercury, higher in Omega-3's, and sustainably caught.  That said, in a taste test done on the first can, I did prefer the Bumble Bee Gold can (their top tuna).  The other reviewers are on point - this one has more flavor.  The  funny thing: it actually tastes more like real tuna (and good tuna at that), whereas the Bumble Bee seems to have been bleached of the flavor somehow.  Anyway, I'd liken it to starting on whole wheat...I bet in a couple of weeks I'll prefer this one.  I will definitely be switching over."
77871,B001LG940E,4.0,"The idea of carbonated fruit juice replacing standard sodas is a good one.  So many people drink a lot of soda.  This indeed is a healthier option.  However, I was disappointed.  Despite being called Black Cherry, this soda actually contained quite a number of different juices and the cherry flavor was subtle.  It tasted like a carbonated juice box.  If you must have carbonation, then I would suggest this.  If you can do without carbonation, then save yourself the money (these are pricey) and just buy juice."
160124,B001EO5YN4,3.0,"I searched quite a while looking for specific flavors of Yummy Earth lollipops.  I was excited to see the description for this item including the exact flavors I wanted.

This does not match the flavors we were sent of Pomegranate Pucker, Mango Tango, Tooberry Blueberry, Wet-Face Watermelon.  This is also a non-returnable item so I am stuck with lollipop flavors that I didn't order. I am very disappointed that we did not receive the flavors as advertised on Amazon."

It seems a little much for this seller to ask twice that price for the same thing (same size, same brand, and not including shipping)....even if we are on the mainland and can't just go to Long's to get it.  If you're desperate, get it, but try to shop around first; this price seems silly."

All 36 bars in arrived in good condition and I'm satisfied with the process.  Now I remember why I ordered what I did.  In order to get FREE Shipping, your order had to be at least $25."
78887,B000HK9IKG,4.0,"The chocolate flavor is the first SweetLeaf stevia that I purchased (after having tried Whole Foods' store brand) and I really like it! I was worried, since I ordered two bottles with the subscribe&safe! At first, I couldn't taste a noticeable chocolate flavor, but have discovered that it takes a bit of experimentation to find just the right number of drops depending on what you are sweetening. So far, I have tried it in unsweetened almond milk, which tastes like a milkshake, and added 11 drops to a bottle of water to make it taste like a chocolate-y treat instead of plain old water. Makes it a lot easier to drink enough water throughout the day! I also used this in spaghetti sauce! I used to put a pinch of sugar and/or a bit of chocolate in my from scratch spaghetti sauce, but can't do that anymore... I made the sauce, thought it was missing something so decided to try a few drops of this chocolate stevia -- it definitely elevated the sauce to a whole new level. I was pleasantly surprised! The stevia does have a bit of an aftertaste when I use it in coffee or tea, hot, but when I use cold drinks, I don't have that problem. I think my taste buds are getting used to the stevia, so I will try hot beverages again soon. If you are new to stevia, I recommend adding one drop, shaking, taste, then adding another, and so on, until you find your magic number.  If you can't have sugar and don't want to use artificial sweeteners (which all taste like poison to me!), it's definitely worth a try with the liquid stevias. I am happy I experimented and have since ordered more flavors... can't wait to try more!"

We have 3 cases now...  I know you can get better expiration dates than that so was disappointed and took off a star.  Otherwise it's a great alternative to peanut butter and from what we've heard so far...better for you."
125102,B001RYK45E,1.0,"My wife bought two cans of this ""no sugar added"" pie filling thinking it would contain, you know, cherries without added sweetener.  I baked the filling into a pie without noticing the teeny ""Splenda"" symbol down along the bottom edge of the label (see product photo).  To our disappointment we discovered the artificial sweetener on our first bite of pie.  To our tastes, the pie was inedible and we threw it out. Personally, I'd have preferred an actual ""no sugar added"" filling but even sugar would be better for you than an artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Since Comstock obviously needs to do a better job of labeling it's products, I went to leave them feedback on their website.  Unfortunately, they wanted every bit of my personal contact information (Email, phone and address) in order to do them a favor and provide feedback on their product. Hopefully they get this message."

162129,B002CENRLG,3.0,"When the five packs arrived they were much smaller than I expected, so I made one large spaghetti casserole with meatballs. Like others mentioned it had a fishy smell at first, but after cooking it there was no trace of the smell. The casserole was pretty good, although the texture was somewhat chewier than you would expect from normal spaghetti, and you could tell you weren't eating the usual processed carbohydrates. Given the high price for a small amount of noodles I don't see this as a viable diet alternative -- I would have to spend way too much to replace my normal noodle intake. Fine then, I'll eat less and exercise more.<br /><br />A note about making a large casserole - YOU CAN NOT FREEZE THESE NOODLES!  I froze the leftovers, and when I thawed some out a couple of weeks later the noodles had turned into a desiccated rat's nest. It was like eating a knotted ball of butcher's twine. Blech."

78360,B00064VQO4,4.0,This is a great quality olive oil with a slightly grassy overtone to the flavor. It's obviously a bit more expensive than your average everyday supermarket olive oil; but it is well worth the money.
16488,B000E8Y5CM,5.0,This is the only tea in my house. I love its peachy taste and the ginger is very subtle. I have a cup every evening to put a soothing touch on my day.

79568,B003TNANSO,4.0,"My nearby Fresh and Easy Market has a display of Kind Plus bars and I find it difficult to pass without picking one up. I like the nutritional specs and the low sugar content of the bars. Plus they're quite good tasting. I often have one as desert with my evening meal, as is the case tonight. This one was Almond Cashew with Flax. It was good, but I didn't care for it as much as several others. The chocolate one is my favorite. In any case, this is a good bar with good nutrition.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
17615,B000CMIYWC,5.0,"I agree with the other reviewers -- it's a great beverage for the kind of congestion you get with a cold, and that's why I started drinking it. But now I've gotten so addicted to it that it's the first thing I reach for when I want something hot. And it's great for those of us with acidic stomachs who are not supposed to have black tea or mint (there is a little mint in this, but only enough to give you a hint of the flavor). And the licorice is mild enough not to taste very much like licorice and just makes it sweet enough not to need sugar. Perfect in every way."
164029,B0046HCSJE,3.0,"I like that this is organic, because corn is one of the most genetically modified products out there.  I use it to coat tofu to fry it so it makes it nice and crispy.  It's more expensive and I'll keep looking for a local source for it.  It is just like regular corn starch to use so you won't notice anything strange about it.  Box is about the same size as a standard box of corn starch.  There was a snafu with the shipping though.  I ordered two boxes, and they shipped the two boxes in two SEPARATE larger boxes, and charged my credit card for four boxes.  I got it worked out, but it was a bit of a hassle.  Honest mistake I'm sure, but yucky."
155445,B000GAT6NG,3.0,"Love the taste, great for stir frys as well as a great additive to smoothies. I'm in two minds over the health issue though; searching medical journals only seems to show a vast majority of negative results (this stuff *is* mostly saturated fat after all) with a huge number of hits on sites which frankly sell this stuff. I don't know but I felt the need to balance all the glowlingly positive reviews...they jury is still out on whether this stuff really is good for you (hydrogenated coconut oil certainly isn't...this stuff is hopefully different)"
16885,B001LGGH40,5.0,"I was actually very surprised when I took my first swig. I didn't pay attention to the ingredients, so I was expecting your typical, dull 10% fruit juice taste. To my surprise--a good thing--I was very pleased.<br />One can really taste the fruitiness of this 100% fruit beverage, and I've tasted many in my day.<br />The carbonation isn't too forcefull, either, allowing you to drink Switch very smoothly. Finally, a great alternative to your energy drinks that claim to have a fruit flavor. Say goodbye to man-made energy, and say hello to nature's source of pure health and revival."
76986,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"The Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is delicious.<br /><br />Texture: Crunchy and yet breaks down immediately as you chew - you don't feel like you'll ruin your dental work or that your jaw is going to be sore after a bowl.<br /><br />Sweetness: The granola itself is lightly sweetened without any fructose or high fructose corn syrup. They used cane juice, brown rice syrup, and molasses as sweeteners.<br /><br />Chocolate Chunks: I love chocolate and can be a little picky about it. This is very good quality chocolate. This surprised me. It is not too sweet and has just a touch of nutty bitterness to make the flavor linger without being offensive to those who like a more mellow chocolate.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars is for the folks who don't like the chocolate to be so strong. The flavor really lingers. I love that. Some folks may not. And, some may not see it as breakfast food. Even so it will make an awesome snack."
16746,B001LGGH40,5.0,"When I ordered this drink, I hoped that it would provide a sweet, somewhat more healthy alternative to my usual soda fix.  I wanted to be optimistic, but after the nasty aftertaste from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, I didn't hold out too much hope.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how refreshing and tasty this drink is.  I tastes mostly like strawberry, with a slight hint of grape.  The carbonation is very mild and makes the whole thing keep from being too syrupy or tasting too sweet.<br /><br />This is now my favorite way to get 100% of my daily Vitamin C, which is a lot more than I get from Coke."

253496,B004JRMG98,2.0,"I'm not a huge fan of spicy foods but I love the flavor of peppers and thought that this would be a good blend because of the creamyness of the sauce.  Surprisingly even I was underwhelmed by the flavors found in this sauce.  It tastes like a watered down version of something that could have been delicious had it been made with a stronger jalapeno flavor. When putting it on tacos the flavors got lost between all of the other items on the taco and it really wasn't much different than putting sour cream on it.  I think you would need a significant amount on each taco for you to be able to really notice that it has a different flavor than sour cream.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, there just wasn't enough flavor for me to really care weather it was on my taco one way or another."

77549,B003NC754G,4.0,"I wanted to try blue popping corn, since I have purchased blue corn meal to make cornbread.  I had read somewhere that blue corn contained a lower glycemic index than yellow corn.  Anyway, this popcorn smells great and tastes wonderful.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it takes more of this popcorn (than yellow O. Redenbacher) to fill a bowl.  And because the little kernels are smaller -- and lighter -- it's a bit of a challenge to use the air popper.  I found that if I use a tea towel and carefully tilt the air popper as they are almost popped, then they gently fall into the bowl.  Otherwise, they tend to just pop and stay there (above the hot air) to burn, because they don't ""jump"" out and into the bowl like the yellow popcorn.  I've also tried to pop the ""traditional"" method, in a large heavy pot with a small amount of oil.  They taste great, but don't all pop. So be prepared for many ""old maids"".  However, a great thing, in addition to the taste, is that there are virtually no little hulls that stick in your teeth or gums as compared to the yellow."
252047,B003VIL6BK,2.0,"First, I typically love products produced by Pacific Natural Foods. This was not a winner in my book. The smell was the first thing that turned me off. I had to wait five minutes to even try the soup because it smelled so awful. When I tasted it, the spices used were overpowering and it was difficult to taste any sweet potato. What I could taste reminded me of curry and it seems like the soup could be married well with rice. Unfortunately as the soup is now, it would be too runny to pour over rice. I suppose a person could add some sweet potato and regular potatoes to make it thicker. I drowned the soup with saltines and it was edible but not enjoyable. I'm giving it two stars because I think with modifications it could be used for different non-soup purposes. Better luck next time Pacific."
77578,B001LG940E,4.0,"I don't generally drink anything but water, coffee and tea, do not like soda, and only use juice in smoothies, so was surprised that I like the Switch juice drink as much as I do.  I've only tried two flavors, the Black Cherry, and the Kiwi Berry; they are pretty similar but I slightly prefer the Black Cherry.  The fruit names are silly anyway as they use a blend of several fruits.<br /><br />The carbonation is very light and the mixed fruit concentrate they use has a very pleasant flavor.  There is no added sugar or fake sweeteners which seem to be in so many prepared beverages these days.  Because it is juice only and a slight amount of carbonation, there is no after taste.<br /><br />Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find these drinks to be too sweet at all, and I fully expected to considering all juice usually tastes pretty darn sweet to me.

This dog food is reasonably priced BUT looking at the pictures on the label I expected to see assorted veggies higher on the ingredients list.  Corn IS high on the ingredients list and TOO MUCH corn isn't agreeable with my dog's' tummy, and causes poop-issues and sensitivity/allergy.<br /><br />I like that there are added vitamin supplements but can do without the added sugar. The assorted colors and shapes of the kibbles look cute and appealing to this human, not sure the colors make a difference to my pooch. He eats this food happily but it doesn't agree with his tummy which doesn't make me too happy. His abundant paw licking isn't because this dog food was paw-licking good, his food sensitivity/allergy has returned. The food allergy may also cause runny eyes and scratching due to the dry itchy skin and I have to give him Children's Benadryl and Fish Oil like the last Vet visit recommendation.<br /><br />So I'll cook brown rice and mix that half rice/half Beneful and he can get by OK. I'll continue my search for a dog food that is BOTH heathful for the dog AND convenient for me. Cooking regularly for the dog isn't a life goal yet."
252256,B0046GSTUM,2.0,"So, I have been trying to get away from peanuts and peanut products, and am looking for a peanut butter substitute to love. This is not quite it.<br /><br />First, it was delivered on a hot day. I opened it immediately and found an unappetizing looking soup swilling around in the jar. I usually do not refrigerate my peanut butter, but this really needed cooling down, so into the refrigerator it went.<br /><br />Once it had had a few days to acquire the appropriate consistency, I tried eating some ... on bread, on celery ... all I can say about the flavor is there is none or, if there is, my tastebuds refuse to recognize it. The texture is more grainy than crunchy.<br /><br />Too bad it is a 16 oz jar ... I would feel less guilty throwing it away. Maybe  I can toss it with breadcrumbs and put it out for the birds."
148645,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"Sure it sounds good and looks yummy on the box, but this is one mess of a ""candy"" bar. First of all, the peanut butter is all over the bottom (or is it the top?), so it forces you to use the wrapper or else. The flavor is a little more bland than I had expected as well. Overall, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rush out and buy any in the future."

77140,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"This granola is a perfect snack when craving a good crunch. The granola is hearty and yummy with just the right amount of chocolate chunks throughout. Not sugary, not too sweet either. It reminds me of a hard choco chip granola bar broken up into pieces. There were two issues though:<br /><br />1) It was so tasty, it was hard to put down. There are a lot of calories in granola and you must be able to control yourself or you could eat a third of the bag easily breaking your caloric intake ceiling for the day.<br /><br />2) Mine arrived packed well but the granola clusters were mostly broken up into little granules which made it harder to eat. I couldn't really pick up the pieces to eat after the first few servings. I had to put some in the palm of my hand and kind of dump it into my mouth. Not my favorite way to eat.<br /><br />Other than that, I would recommend this granola."

I switched to Enfamil after the Similac recall, and I have half a mind now to return to Similac because of the annoyance of the Enfamil container (plus Enfamil is more expensive!).  I'm sure the formula itself is good stuff (hence the 2 stars), but you wind up losing a fair bit every time you empty the stupid bag into the plastic bin. -- It's POWDER, after all, so it practically clouds up and is messy.  And the hinged top of the plastic bin is loose, and the scoop isn't as secure as the Similac device, etc., etc.  HATE it.  And the whole notion of buying refill bags is a racket because they're hard to find and represent NO savings.  What were the Johnson Mead people thinking?!?  I wish they had just copied the Similac design.  Or better yet, I wish the Abbott people hadn't screwed up with the need to recall . . ."

76935,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I really wasn't sure how I was supposed to eat the granola chunks when I first received the package, because they were more like the granola that you add to yogurt - in small pieces.  But there were also pieces that were too big to be topping.  So I used them both as finger food and a yogurt topping.  I find that alone, it's a little too sweet, and as a yogurt topping, it's nothing special.  However, it's not a bad snack, because it uses some good ingredients and the dark chocolate helps add extra taste.  In other words, this is a light, fun, and tasty snack that won't put you back too  many fat calories, and provides some nutritious benefits as well.  Just don't expect something that redefines granola as a snack."

75637,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"The only fear I had in trying out this No Fear energy drink was the fact that it was the fully loaded calorie version (I normally drink low cal versions to spare my tire a bit).  I shrugged off the calories and chugged down this drink.  Taste was actually pretty good - not to overpowering and not too weak - kind of a generic non-offensive taste.  As for energy - nothing too noticeable for me, maybe just a bit of an extra pick-me-up from the full sugar version.<br /><br />Net, net I would drink this again if it was laying around (such as in a buddy's fridge).  But, I wouldn't buy it myself - at $2.50 per pop I would just stick with my tried and true brands such as Monster Lo Carb.  At a lower than major brand price point I might be more inspired."

I have no complaint about the seed quality, but the shipping costs from this seller are high even if you order a number of items together. Ordering just one or two items is out of the question because shipping costs are so high. On the plus side, the costs for many of their items are very low, so it can cancel out the high shipping. Be aware that if you order more than one item at a time in the same order, shipping is reduced on a per item basis, so take that into consideration when you see over $10 shipping for a couple tiny items!"

126995,B0048Z8OCO,1.0,"With an enormous range of essential ingredients, including krill oil, a super-antioxidant rarely found in other pet foods, this product is ostensibly ideal for both cats and dogs. THE PROBLEM is that it contains so many NON-ORGANIC ingredients, including corn protein. Newer studies just released point to a greatly increased risk of tumors in animals that are fed corn, simply because ALL of the corn grown in the USA has been genetically modified (courtesy of one very large multi-national corporation whose name is familiar around the world.)

They're made of soft and sweet granola, with the flavor pieces mixed in, chocolate on the bottom, and chocolate drizzled on top. They're very tasty, and surprisingly satisfying for 100 calorie snacks. I am always on the lookout for good 100 calorie snacks, and these babies definitely fill the bill!"

I first tried this brownie mix when I was planning my Christmas gift baking last year and a cousin announced she had to eat gluten free. I was hesitant to invest in a lot of expensive ingredients I might or might not use again, so I purchased a box of this brownie mix, then tried to think of ways of how to doctor it up and make it into something that I hoped would be special.<br /><br />I came up with an idea, shipped the brownies off to her, and waited to hear if they were any good.  (I warned her that it was my first experiment in gluten free baking.)  Well, let me tell you...that grown woman went through the entire batch of brownies in under two days - they were a hit!<br /><br />I tried another recipe this week for her birthday, which is today, and the results are just in:  in her words, ""You hit it out of the park with these!""  Happily, my reputation as a fabulous baker now extends into the gluten-free realm...with a little help from Arrowhead Mills!<br /><br />Here are two ideas to get you started:<br /><br />#1 - Get a box of this brownie mix, and also a box of the Arrowhead Mills chocolate chip cookie mix.  Prepare each mix according to the directions on the boxes.  Place little mounds of the cookie dough randomly in a 9 X 13 pan, then spoon the brownie mixture around the mounds to fill in the empty spaces.  Bake.<br /><br />#2 - Prepare brownie mix according to directions and pour into a 9 X 13 pan.  In a separate bowl, mix 8 oz. of cream cheese, one egg, and a tsp. of vanilla.  Drop dollops of the cream cheese batter onto the brownie mix; run a knife or spatula through to give a swirled, marble effect. Bake.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying this again; I have a lot more recipe ideas I want to try out on her, and may even offer fancy gluten free brownie creations to my customers."

First of all, these cookies are dry and hard as a rock. I know ginger snaps are sometimes crisp but you could chip a tooth on these things. Also the flavor is not my favorite. The ginger flavor is a little strange and they have a very strong orange taste. Overall the flavor of these cookies is just too overpowering. I did not finish the bag and would not buy these again."

There used to be real pure fruit leathers made from the actual fruit (Apricot, Strawberry, etc) but for some reason they disappeared from the market about 10 years ago (last company I recall was 'Nature ...' something). I guess like everything else these days the emphesis is 'make it on the cheap' and forget the real quality.<br /><br />It's a shame if it's merely a cost decision, there's a bonafide market out there for the real thing even if it's a little more expensive."

I shared a few with some coworkers and while it did at first go as the tablets before, it wore off very quickly. Perhaps in the span of 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />The tablets are oval in shape and almost twice as large as the ones before, but I noticed the tablets tasted a bit different from the other brand. I couldn't be certain, but the mixture they form these tablets with could be binder heavy and less product overall.

They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway, I contacted the company (Oskri) and their quality department was great. They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product. I did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight & contents of the bar are the same. The calories, fat & sugar have all increased (180 cals vs. 246 cals, 11 grams vs. 14 grams, 14 grams vs. 29 grams). That is unfortunate, and I will have to cut down on my consumption. However, these bars really do taste yummy! They are soft, chewy, sweet & fresh. My husband and I love them, and I have gotten a few friends hooked on them too!"
167727,B005UQ0IXS,3.0,"These candies have an initial weird chemical taste. I thought they would be really sour right off the bat, but it took a few minutes to get to the sour core. Not bad, just not what I was expecting. The packaging consists of 24 small boxes, each box containing about a dozen lemonheads. This makes it convenient to carry around"
77677,B001LG940E,4.0,"This is good if drank cold, it could be used as a mix too. It is a little steep in price and high in calories too. If you don't mind the price and want a natural alternative to soda it is good."
126582,B001EUG65I,1.0,"Seriously?? By whose standards??<br /><br />Since when are wheat starch, glycerin, cellulose, potato starch, bacon flavor (?what does this mean?) healthy?<br /><br />I bought this thinking it would last a few hours or days but my dog just gobbled it up in minutes.<br /><br />I love the nylabone chew products but I don't recommend these unless you have very large dogs that can eat them as treats."
244717,B0029JXPHA,2.0,I'm so disappointed in this product. 2 months past the Best By date! How ridiculous. The candy is hard and I don't even want to eat this.
240411,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"mmmmm no. The first 2 ingredients are corn meal and the notorious 'chicken by-product meal.' This is one of those things that has a name that makes it sound good, but it's really not. We try it occasionally when we can't find our preferred foods (usually ProPlan, which is in the same price arena, but occasionally the fancier kinds), and it makes our dog (a 60ish-lb hound mutt) poop like CRAZY each time. She usually goes only 1-2 times each day, but when she eats this she gets the runny poops and goes 5 times a day or more. Can't be making her feel awesome.<br /><br />I was told by a friend years ago that his vet told him that Beneful is ""like potato chips for dogs"" and I believe it. Tastes great I'm sure, but not a whole lot of goodness in there. Also, as other commenters have said, the suggested serving size of this is larger than for better dog food, so IF you follow those rules, the savings isn't as great as you'd think."
241601,B0081XPTBS,2.0,"This is a great food brand, and I also like their diapers, but this formula does NOT dissolve well, and my 2 month old baby does not like it!!  He is mostly breastfed, but I supplement with Similac Organic with good results (no fussiness).  I gave Earth's Best a try, and my 10 week old baby cried and cried, and was having obvious gas pain, until I switched back to Similac.  I would much prefer to use this brand, so I tried again a few weeks later, and I got the same reaction from my baby.  I would definitely us caution when choosing this formula, although I realize all babies are different.  I will continue to use Earth's Best's other products, but not this formula."
129388,B003GRGOEK,1.0,"I was hoping for something similar to Jacks, which is my favorite. It is a little thinner than most, with smaller bits of tomatoes and cilantro, the way I like it. However, this was so salty I couldn't eat more than two bites. I poured it down the drain."
249735,B001LGGH54,2.0,"We're not soda drinkers in our household, an occasional sprite maybe but otherwise I like to mix club soda with fruit juice when I'm in the mood for something bubbly. This sounded intriguing since it's toted as being all natural.<br /><br />I expected a much less sweet flavor, not that it was bad just that it was VERY VERY sweet and candy like. I'm also shocked by the high calories, granted juice in general is high calorie but I was still surprised. My husband really liked the taste and even considered it refreshing so your opinion will likely vary pending what you're accustomed to. Not something I would give my 5yr old or reach for again myself."
81887,B005CUU25G,4.0,"When I picked up the padded envelope from our mail basket, my cocker spaniel snapped to attention.  By the time I had the bottle out of the envelope, the Rottweiler had joined us.  Their anxiety grew as I struggled to break the plastic wrap around the top.  Finally I had the bottle ready for action, after a very long 30 seconds.<br />I had to rub the roller ball to get the liquid inside to lubricate the ball.  Squeezing the bottle forces the liquid to ooze around the ball.  Both dogs wanted to eat the bottle rather than lick the ball.  They give it a five-star review and suggest that the Vine program send more to our house.<br /><br />The rottie still wants to eat the bottle. The cocker has learned the licking technique.  The cocker is quite responsive to the sound of the bottle being shaken. (Cockers are the original foodies.)<br /><br />The major problem I have is that the ball does not move freely.  I get some liquid on the ball and hold it out for the cocker.  She licks it very clean.  Then I have to squeeze more liquid out and roll the ball around with my thumb.<br /><br />The ingredients seem to be healthy, or as healthy as something with bacon fat in it can be.<br /><br />This product can be a great training reward, but you will have a sticky thumb. The first time I offered my thumb to be licked clean, the cocker started to eat it. If you are training your dog, you probably will want a rag to keep your thumb clean.<br /><br />My vine review philosophy is to first test the product without regard to price.  Now that I have checked the price, currently around $8, it seems a good value for a training tool.  $8 does not buy a decent size bag of training treats.  And the dogs are much more responsive to the bacon than to freeze-dried lumps.  However as just a treat for being a good dog in general, it is not as satisfying as a regular-sized biscuit.  Pity my poor dogs who are only getting this one bottle of bacon treat."
156427,B000QEQVBW,3.0,"I just sent this as a wedding gift last week, now found several sites that say this is a hoax. They say you can't really name a star, it's only done through certain organization called IAU, here is Wikipedia's answer:<br /><br />The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the internationally recognized authority which designates stars, planets, asteroids, comets, and other heavenly bodies according to internationally accepted rules. The IAU does not sell naming rights nor does it authorize any other company or organization to do so. The IAU cautions consumers that products and services marketed by ISR and other companies have no formal or official validity whatsoever. In fact with a few exceptions of ancient or Arabic names, nearly all stars are designated by catalog numbers rather than names.[8]<br /><br />The IAU has called the ISR's star-naming business far from dangerous ""charlatanry"" and their products and marketing have been criticised for ""seem[ing] official.""[9][10] The company clarifies the products it sells on its frequently asked questions page stating:<br /><br />Astronomers will not recognize your name because your name is published only in our Star catalog.[4]"

18047,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"After reading the wonderful reviews of PB2, I was still skeptical but every rave review was right on the money!!<br /><br />The reduction in fat and calories is a gift from the peanut butter gods.  The fact that you mix it up as you go (which takes, literally, no more than 15 seconds) is a great help for people like me who sometimes like to settle down with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon, only to realize a zillion calories later what I have done.  You can control the texture by adding or subtracting the water recommended.  There's plenty of peanut flavor and they've added a bit of sugar (I assume to offset the lack of fat) but it is a very small amount and still adds far less in calories than all that subtracted fat and oil.<br /><br />The chocolate PB2 is also completely awesome.  I eat it straight and it's almost like chocolate mousse.  Sometimes I pop in a little regular PB2 if I'm not wanting it so sweet but any way you mix it, it rocks.<br /><br />I ordered and received $100.00 worth and I love the comfort of knowing my PB2 is there for the forseeable future.<br /><br />I hope that the word gets out to all the people who will love this product.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

151501,B001EQ5O4G,3.0,"I found this coffee to be slightly better than the Eight O'Clock French Roast that I purchased on the same day.  Honestly though, it makes me wonder if the beans sold in these bags are the same beans used at Starbucks.<br /><br />The coffee seemed weak and astringent, and while certainly not without merit, it just doesn't seem to be worth the cost.  The 3-pack sold here averages out to almost $10 a bag -- for $10, you can get something from Atomic Cafe or the Roasterie that will have you jumping out of bed every morning in anticipation of that first cup of TRULY excellent coffee."
133867,B002AR14WO,1.0,"I had really enjoyed a sample I'd received, so I think it's possible that the product I ultimately ordered from Amazon should have been better.  If quality control is so inconsistent, I guess I wouldn't take a chance again.  I guess either something went wrong in the recipe, or in the filling of the tea bags at the factory, or maybe it was stored too long in the wrong conditions, because the product was really weak.  Too bad."
253078,B0018CDUKQ,2.0,"My dog is allergic and my vet suggested to change its food. After reading the ingredients of this product, I thought it would be a good option. When the product arrived, I mixed it with his previous food to make it a gradual change but my dog only ate the previous food. Maybe he didn't like the taste. I had to feed him in the mouth but he vomits it. The first time this happened I thought it was maybe due to anything else so I feed him with Nature's variety food again and he did vomit again. I just wasted my money and my poor dog had a hard time with this food."
238549,B003A02VFO,2.0,This Creme Bouquet was not like any I have used in the past. The lemon flavor was overwhelming and I could not taste any other flavor. Unfortunately I am not able to use this in my frosting or cake as I normally would.
17562,B000CMIYWM,5.0,I have been drinking this tea for several years. It is great when you feel Stressed. Within a few hours of drinking it makes me feel in a relaxed and peaceful state of mind. I highly recommend this tea.
17604,B000CMIYWC,5.0,"I am amazed by how well this tea works to relieve my chronic congestion and recurring sinus problems. And it's not just a ""quick"" fix either -- its therapeutic effects last for hours. I was a bit worried the tea would be a bit too ""licorice-y"" since one of its main ingredients is licorice root, but the fragrance and taste are mild and incredibly soothing. If you think this package of six boxes is too much, you'll be happily proven wrong ... I would stock my entire garage with this tea if I could!"
124893,B005BHIESC,1.0,"It tastes . . . how to put this . . . gawdawful.  There's very little fruity flavor - it actually tastes more salty than anything else.  They need a little more attention to quality control as well.  On two (make that three - no wait, four) of the twelve cartons, the spout came unglued from the container, making it difficult to open/pour and downright impossible to reseal.<br /><br />Color me singularly unimpressed.  I'm sure glad I didn't pay full price for it."
248459,B00016LZT8,2.0,"I chose this brand of cheese powder over Trio, which I'd used in the past and really liked, because this was less expensive. It came with no directions at all so I winged it remembering how I'd used the Trio sauce. This ended up thin and very salty. I had to eventually add thickener to get the consistency without making it horribly salty, but that made it more a ""gravy"" than a ""sauce"". I'll still use it up, but won't buy it again."
79110,B000LKYNLG,4.0,"These are our favorite refried beans.  Of course, these are just the base -- we add chili powder, cumin, and garlic.  The beans themselves are good, and I like being able to season them to my own taste."
76015,B000FKQDAQ,4.0,"the candy tastes really good. Especially the light yellow and red ones, they are of real fruit savory.  But I don't know why my teeth get very sensitive by eating them, especially with one of my teeth, once I take more than 6 pc per day, it will get so sore and sensitive that I can not bite anything with it."
76656,B0049ULB78,4.0,"Dark Magic doesn't taste overwhelming.  No burnt flavor. Tolerable straight black. I add creamer and one packet of stevia and it still holds it's bold flavor, just a little milder.  Nutty taste."
246319,B0009F3SB4,2.0,"This should be renamed Fennel tea. Because that's all I could taste. Yes, it is the first ingredient and I probably should have acknowledged that more, but its different than chewing on fennel seeds at the end of an Indian meal. It is Fennel. Strange and sweetened by licorice (which also has a pronounced taste).<br /><br />As a fasting tea, I came to see it as: if you force yourself to drink a cup before a meal, you will lose you appetite entirely. Effective, sure. But certainly unpleasant. I'd rather have a different cup of Yogi tea, like Egyptian Licorice or Gingko Clarity to take my mind off of eating and satisfy restless tastebuds."
249376,B004TPKAN4,2.0,"I was looking forward to these. The shipment got lost in the mail and arrived three weeks late, however, from inspecting the cookies inside they were not damaged at all. The cookies have a very VERY good gingery taste without any after-taste of chemistry. Organic as homemade, just as you want from Newman's Own. They are riddled with chunks of candied ginger, too, to amplify the flavor. Flavor is top notch.  A ginger-snap is supposed to be crispy... BUT... these are hard-cooked to dog-biscuit consistency, over-browned on the bottom and tooth-breaking solid. Would not purchase again, unless I run into a few in the bottom of the bag not so dark and hard."
16628,B001LGGH40,5.0,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is really good.  The taste is different.  It has a nice sour taste, and also is healthier than soda due to the low sugar content."

150627,B000HDHZZI,3.0,"I paid $5.46 for this and bc of this am happy with the purchase. It's quality and tasty product but the 12 boxes definitely are smaller than I normally buy at the store. Good deal, for that price, but I wouldn't purchase again."
80544,B001EO5ROA,4.0,"I occasionally like to add a little flavor to my club soda or mineral water & this gives me a healthy choice. For me it's very sweet, because I really restrict my carb intake. It only takes a couple of drops in a 16 oz. bottle of water, to satisfy me."

My first impression of it was that it was absolutely disgusting.  Doesn't taste a THING like peanut butter (obviously).  The next day at work, I decided to give it another shot, and it was better.  Day 3, one more chance, this time on a sandwich, and it's actually pretty good. Nutritionally, the only difference between this & peanut butter is that this has zero sodium.  Other than that, they're pretty similar. I would definitely buy this.  You just gotta give it a chance."
158037,B000PWTCBQ,3.0,"I really enjoyed this drink having 1st been introduced to it in the UK. It is a yummy ginger drink, warms you up, quite strong in flavor, which is good and a good value.  The only downfall is that it is high in sugar and that is why i've given it 3 * instead of 4.  It is a little too sweet, i would prefer it to have less sugar/honey in it a) for the flavor and b) because of the calories.  However, I do enjoy a cup occasionally as a treat."

Also, there are not nearly enough cranberries in it.  Not your mother's oatmeal--that's for sure. Mom would have been a lot more generous with the almonds and cranberries."
77571,B001LG940E,4.0,"Personally I tasted more apple/cherry than just straight cherry and it was a smidge too sweet for me.  However this being said, if you're going to try and cut back on your pop intake and want to put something more natural in your body, I highly recommend this as a starting point.  Even if there is still natural sugar in the can, there is also the benefits of having natural juice and vitamin c which aren't found in most pops."

Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C"">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G"">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

75962,B003WREBIK,4.0,"Considering I've tried many different types of ice creams, gelatos, and frozen yogurts, I had high hopes for Arctic Zero. My creamy, cold, partially frozen desserts have got to taste good, melt in the mouth, and satisfy the craving appropriately.<br />Don't expect Ben & Jerry's or full-fat quality from this ice cream. By reading the ingredients alone, there's no magical spell that can transform monk fruit, water, and whey protein into egg yolks, granulated sugar, and cream.<br /><br />Arctic Zero's Cookies and Cream ice cream is a smooth and slightly slippery textured sweet treat. My first experience with monk fruit was in this ice cream and I've got to say it has a nicely sweet flavor to it without the cooling effects of artificial sweeteners. Taste is great, in my opinion! It definitely reminded me of a watered down cookies and cream flavor. There is no texture or cookie bits in here, though.<br /><br />The color is a slightly off grey, purple hue. I really liked it. If you've ever had taro flavored milk or bubble tea, it looks just like that. It also tastes similar to taro bubble tea. Maybe this is why I enjoy it so much!<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a shot to try in the grocery store before you go buying a mega pack. You will either love it or leave it. I appreciate that a mostly natural, low calorie, satisfying option is available and will continue to support and lovingly consume Arctic Zero!"

It is a waste to prepare a ""large"" cup with this, since it can easily handle a ""large+small"", which amounts to ~400ml of rich coffee. If you like espresso, go with small. Worth every penny, thank you Newman :)<br /><br />PS: Decaf is equally good."
166497,B000V1WXH6,3.0,My family loves olives and we generally go through a bag this size in a couple weeks.  These took us much longer to finish since the taste was not to our liking and the olives had lots of broken pits in them.  I will not be buying these olives again.

254739,B007PA32L2,2.0,One of the weakest KCup varieties I've tried.  It was like drinking spiced water.  No creaminess at all.  The spice is also a little off - very clove-y.  Brewed on the smallest setting it's drinkable but definitely not what I was hoping for.
163597,B0001CXUHW,3.0,It's small and granular and makes your bread rise. There's quite a lot of it here too. I'm not sure how I'm ever going to use it all up making two loaves of bread a week.
255867,B000LKTHHQ,2.0,"This chocolate was only fair. It certainly was interesting with the chilis, but the texture of the chocolate was very grainy, even for a chocolate that has nibs (which I prefer). I will not buy this again."

77028,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I had doubts about this cereal.  I don't like super-sweet cereals, and I haven't cared for chocolate breakfast food since I got over the Cocoa Krispies craze of my youth.  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the chocolate flavor, while definitely present, is not overwhelming, and the sweetness level is tolerable.  Best of all, it reminded me why I used to like Cocoa Krispies - it left the same chocolate milk in my bowl at the end!<br /><br />I compared Chocolate Delight to Post Bran Flakes, a cereal that was recently named a ""Best Bite"" by Nutrition Action Newsletter.  Both are made primarily of whole grains (oats in the case of the granola, wheat in the bran flakes).  Both contain sweeteners, and as one would expect, the chocolate granola contains more sweetener because it includes chocolate chips.  The flakes have 5 g of fiber in a half-cup serving; the granola, 4.  The bran flakes have much more sodium - 220 mg compared to 5 mg in the granola.  The granola has more carbs (again, the chocolate), but also more protein, 5 g to the flakes' 3 g.  The bran flakes have significantly more vitamin A and iron, but the granola has more calcium (although only 2% of the RDA, not counting any milk added).<br /><br />There is a whopping difference in calories:  for half-cup servings, 100 calories for the bran flakes, 220 calories for the granola.  But hey, no one thinks they can eat chocolate for free, do they?<br /><br />The granola is also more expensive, 30 cents per ounce (assuming Amazon's price and super-saver shipping), 24 cents for the bran flakes (purchased at a non-sale price at a grocery store).  I'm not sure that's a significant difference, though, as most sweetened cereals cost more than unsweetened (it's also debatable whether the bran flakes can be considered ""unsweetened,"" since they contain both sugar and corn syrup).<br /><br />Both cereals are crisp in milk, the granola more so because of its crunchy granola clusters, and the granola maintains its crunch, a plus if you like to dawdle over your breakfast bowl.  I don't tend to eat dry cereal as a snack, but if I did, the granola would certainly be the hands-down winner there.  All in all, I was much more satisfied with Chocolate Delight than I expected to be, and if your taste runs to chocolate for breakfast or granola for snacks, it's worth trying.  (If you like it a lot, note the discount for automatic shipping.)"

It tastes just about as sweet as soda but without the corn syrup/sugar.  It is less carbonated than soda but I like that.  It also has a ""lighter"", crisper taste.  The Kiwi Berry flavor is good but my favorite is the Black Cherry flavor.  I recommend both but keep in mind that the can is only 8.3 ounces and costs more than soda.  I think it is worth it!"
124186,B0001AVTDQ,1.0,"I ordered quite a large order from Barry Farms which included the dough enhancer. Their website said that orders would be filled and shipped usually in 48 hours. My order did not ship out for a week, after I sent them an email asking if they had shipped my products yet. I got them today and the whole box of food items that I ordered smells like cigerettes. I thought at first maybe it was the UPS driver but the inside of the cookbook smells like smoke so I am guessing it is at the farm not the driver. Also, the dough enhancer was not at all similar to a different product that I have been using for over a year but there were not ingredients list so I could not compare. I say buyer beware."

124880,B005BHIESC,1.0,"Generally, the flavored Vita Coco varieties are anywhere from alright to very good tasting.  However, this one is outright unpleasant.  There's a strong undertone to this drink that can only be described as medicinal.  It tastes like something you'd drink only if you *had* to in order to speed your recovery from some nasty intestinal bug.<br /><br />Just blech! across the board."
75652,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"From the can, I expected No Fear to be a rather masculine drink. The logo and font suggests a manly drink. I was very surprised to find No Fear had a sweet, peachy taste, like a thin, carbonated peach schnapps. It was smooth, refreshing and very pleasant to drink, but didn't quite match the packaging.<br /><br />No Fear felt as effective an energy drink as a Rockstar or Monster (both come in the same size cans). I drink Rockstars fairly regularly and No Fear gave me more or less the same experience. Its taste is a bit more distinctive than a Rockstar though, so it would be more appropriate (for my tastes at least) as an occasional energy drink rather than your regular brand."
256413,B0023V65GW,2.0,"This is my third box, found this one not to be the same as the last two. The coating for the gummy bears was not the same, maybe this batch was not done? It also didn't taste the same, can't return because its a food item. They need too check their quality control."

137117,B001P05K7M,1.0,"Our vet recommended getting ""C.E.T. chews"" to help clean our dog's teeth, so I looked around online and came across the VeggieDent chews and the HEXtra premium chews. Both of these met the requirement of being ""C.E.T chews"" but they looked (and sounded from the description) very different from each other, so I wasn't sure what kind to buy. Based on the reviews for each, it still wasn't clear what would work better, so I ordered one pack of each. I was worried that the VeggieDent chews would too easily be consumed and therefore wouldn't do much for cleaning her teeth, and I was worried that the HEXtra chews would be a choking hazard because they wouldn't come apart easily enough and she might swallow them whole.<br /><br />The VeggieDent chews were definitely easy for her to break pieces off of, but she was quite happy doing so, and it took her about 15s or maybe a bit more to eat it. She chewed each little piece that broke off while she ate it, and it was definitely cleaning her teeth. The HEXtra chews, however, are a choking hazard, and I will never give her another one. She was very excited to get the HEXtra chew (they smell terrible but apparently good to a dog) and chewed on it for a second or two, and then in one quick gulp it was gone. The whole chew, still in one piece. It was in her mouth for about 2 seconds. She is a VERY strong chewer (she can take chunks off of a black kong easily in 30 seconds or so, and she's a medium-large dog), and had no desire to chew pieces off of the HEXtra chew, I'm guessing because the moistened chew seemed like something to be swallowed whole. The HEXtra chews were useless for cleaning her teeth and a choking hazard, and I would never give her another one.<br /><br />In summary, the VeggieDent chews were great for cleaning our dog's teeth (though they didn't last particularly long, but if you're looking for something to last long, try a kong product), while the HEXtra chews did nothing for our dog's teeth and were also a choking hazard because she swallowed it whole within a second or two.<br /><br />Note: I've posted this review for the VeggieDent chews as well, in case it's useful for people who may be debating between these two types of C.E.T. chews."

I have put it in the freezer for now and plan to try to use it in a trifle or something.<br /><br />I am not sure if I would buy this again, although I find it interesting that some people are getting good results.

240093,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"This is dog food and therefore, I did not consume it myself -- however, based on the colors and shapes of the kibbles, I think Beneful assumes that I will.<br /><br />My dogs ate the food just fine -- no digestive issues and no real complaints... but they are dogs... they would eat out of my cat's litter box if I let them.<br /><br />What struck me as a human is how colorful the kibbles are -- lots of reds and greens. Really? I'm guessing that isn't natural food color there but added to make the food look more appetizing to humans. I'm not a natural health food nut by any stretch of the imagination but even the skeptic in me thinks that at a minimum, they are spending a lot of money on the appearance of the food where I would rather know that that money was going towards nutrition.<br /><br />Finally, I can't be sure but I do believe my dogs are actually ""passing a lot more gas"" since they have been eating this food.

161121,B00008WUA9,3.0,"I've been using this cup/filter combo everyday for 2 months or so.  The cup is nicely constructed and I have no problems with it.<br /><br />However, the filter does not perform very well if you use tea leaves that are very small.  I drink PG Tips loose leaf everyday, 3 times a day.  The leaves are fine and the holes at the bottom of the filter allow the tiniest tea particles to fall through.  If this doesn't bother you, the system works.  If you don't like tea particles at the bottom of your clear cup, it will begin to annoy you.  I bought this system thinking that the few flakes at the bottom of the cup would not bother me but i have resorted to using the filter in another cup and pouring the leaf-free liquid into my drinking cup because there are many unfiltered leaves at the bottom of the cup.  Imagine the entire bottom of the cup covered in the tiniest leaf particles...<br /><br />Also, the filter stains easily.  After two months, there is a hint of yellow orange stain on the side filters.<br /><br />Therefore, if you use larger tea leaves, this system may work decently for you.  If you drink tea like the loose leaf PG Tips that have fine leaves, I would look for an alternative.  Hope this review helps people thinking about drinking PG Tips with this system."

136473,B006Q820X0,1.0,"I don't usually write reviews, but was compelled to advise everyone. I have purchased two different flavors. The first box arrived about a day after the coffee got released. There were about 10 k-cups that were damaged and coffee grounds were everywhere. To Amazon's credit they issued a refund. The second box was delivered with no damage to the k-cups. So I have brewed about 20 of the k-cups and around 50-60% of them are faulty. I never have had this issue with other brands. Either I get a ton of coffee grounds in my coffee or end the end of the brew cycle, when the machine blows air out it splatters coffee grounds all over my coffee cup, coffee maker or counter.

77846,B001LG940E,4.0,"The switch black cherry is a very good product. I love a drink that has no artificial and/or high fructose corn syrup. It is a great refreshing carbonated beverage. Amazon is about the only place I can find this stuff. Luckily, with Prime it doesnt cost anything for shipping. However, the downside is the cans are rather small and the cost is rather high. I would make this one of my primary drinks if it was less expensive. Also, while this isn't ""good"" for you with the amount of sugar it has, at least it is natural fruit sugar and is not as bad for you. But keep in mind this isn't something you want to drink a 25 pack a week as it is still high in calories due to the high natural sugar content.<br /><br />Flavor wise I have tried the fruit punch and the black cherry so far. I would have to say black cherry is my favorite."
167576,B0017L8MGU,3.0,"I know, it IS weird that I would prefer the mini version of Ritter Sport Milk Chocolate with Butter Biscuit bars.  But here is why:  the mini has a more pleasing ratio of chocolate to cookie.  Plus, the parts of the mini become one in my mouth, whereas with the larger bar, the cookie slides away from the chocolate.  The larger cookie is not all that great IMO, being very dry and uncomfortable against the teeth.  I much prefer the Gestalt sort of experience the Mini provides; who wants deconstructed dry cookie moving around all over the place.  Unfortunately, I bought a whole box of these big bars, but thankfully the chocolate is most highly edible.<br /><br />Now, take a look at the picture ... doesn't it look like this bar will be a cookie filled with gooey melty chocolate?  My husband picked up my first Mini for me as a surprise, and I honestly did not find the picture appealing, so I set the Mini aside for a few days.  (First time I've ever done THAT with chocolate.)  But the mini pleasantly surprised me for the reasons I've already mentioned.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try if you already like Ritter Sport.

17393,B000QWBUR4,5.0,"I see there are no other reviews for this item yet. There need to be! It is great, and with recent changes in Twinings lineup, I'm sure more people like me are out there looking for a good replacement-- so I hope this will be helpful to some who are doing as I have done. I took a blind chance on this tea-- and I am so glad I did. I've been a fan of black currant iced tea ever since I first tried it. For years I used Twinings brand, but they have changed their formula and I have read many negative reviews, so I decided to look for a new brand. I tried several others and Mighty Leaf black currant has been the best so far.  If you are a fan of Twinings Black currant (the original) and/or you like the black currant iced teas served by Jason's Deli or Corner Bakery, you will probably really like this tea as it has a very similar taste. It is slightly stronger and has a little more of a ""bite"" than Twinings version did, (which I like)  and it is an excellent quality tea all around. There are several brands out there whose interpretation of what black currant tea tastes like is very far removed from this flavor I am familiar with. A few of them I tried were just downright weird. I am not really sure which black currant taste is more ""authentic"" to be honest, I just know what I like and I am very very happy with this tea. I will be buying this brand from now on for making my iced tea. It is well worth having to order it."

I've tried three different bottles recently, all from different batches, and they were all extremely lackluster.  The great taste is gone, and has been replaced with a rather unpleasant harshness.  I can only hope this change wasn't intentional and things will eventually go back to normal, but for now, I'm disappointed to say that I strongly recommend staying away from this bourbon.  It's simply not worth the price."

Too many flavors for real mint, it gave it a dirty funny taste. I think they tried to do too much here. I see where others loved it, I just did not. I don't think I can drink anymore of it. Be cautioned if your looking for a minty, chocolate tasty treat, this is not it. Too many flavors give it a muddy strange taste. I'm sure I will get slammed for my opinion, people hate people who disagree with them here on Amazon, but in good conscience I could not rate this any better."
161060,B003OGKCDC,3.0,"Isn't the price supposed to get cheaper when you buy in lager quantities? With this product, the 16oz price is simply doubled for the 32oz size. What kind of benefit is that? Why would anyone bother paying before they have to by getting a lager size before the smaller size run out, when you're paying the same price anyway? Just get it when you need it, or you might find something even cheaper by the time the 16oz runs out, then you can really save money."

But after tasting a full dozen of these, I still regret its purchase."
17290,B000EVIDUY,5.0,"I have made these brownies for family and for a den of cub scouts and no one would have known they were gluten free and everyone asked for seconds!  These brownies have a fudgy texture and have bits of chocolate chips in them which are delicious.  I would say the mix is very thick and a little difficult to work with.  The cooked brownies are slightly difficult to cut into very neat edges as the edges tend to crumble a little and I would also say that they make a slightly thinner layer of brownies than most of the store brand gluten containing but they taste just as good, if not better.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />(For those wondering, this mix requires 2 eggs OR 4 egg whites and 7 tbs melted butter to prepare.  They do have suggestions for lactose free and low fat preparations)"

So, I was excited to find the Back to Nature Triple Ginger Cookie on Amazon. I thought the two would be similar.  I was wrong. They are fresh, but do not taste much like ginger.  The taste and texture reminds me of taking the peanuts and peanut butter out of a peanut butter cookie and adding crystalized ginger.  I bought 6 boxes too.  I am willing to try other flavors of the Back to Nature cookies, but I will have to find a source for the Trader Joe's for ginger cookies. I looked for comments on the Back to Nature website and this flavor isn't to be found. Now I know why."
77761,B001LG940E,4.0,"The Switch soda's are a, mostly, excellent alternative to real soda. They cut out some of the worst traits of the major colas like: perservatives and added sugars. Don't let that fool you though, they aren't really a ""health"" drink due to the high calories. They have almost as many calories per serving as an average Coke product. This black cherry flavor has 130 calories.<br /><br />They are slightly more expensive than soda as well, and unfortunately the portions are smaller so if you are factoring this expense on dollar per oz you'll come up short with the Switch sodas. If you are more intersted in flavor than cost, these are definitely a better alternative to soda or fruit juice. The carbonation gives them an extra kick like soda, but they have the great sweet taste of juice without the acidic, artificially flavored taste of Coke or Pepsi products. I would take one of these over a Cherry Coke any day!<br /><br />I tested one can then decided to buy a whole case of 24. Packaging was very sturdy and weathered delivery well. That being said, it is a carbonated beverage, don't leave it sitting on your doorstep too long in freezing temperatures.<br /><br />Just to wrap up, I'd highly recommend them if you don't mind the cost to portion ratio, and aren't under the missimpression that it's a healthy beverage."

This is a European coffee flavor made from the more expensive Acabica beans.<br /><br />I like my coffee hot and use a Farberware coffee percolator, and have use average amount of cream, but with no sugar.  Therefore, I do not want the rich caramel and vanilla flavor since it is sweet.

It's a nice alternative to soda, although an 8.3 ounce can of Back Cherry Switch has 30g of sugar. It's not thick but the sweetness does hit you! One thing that raises my eyebrow (besides the after-taste) was the price of the case. A 24 pack of cans that are slightly smaller than a can of soda for $24 is a little on the high side. Consider a 12 pack of Pepsi (or if you like Coke) which is roughly about $5.99 per pack. If you get 2 packs, you're only paying $12, but if you get a 24 pack of Switch, then your paying over $20 (for smaller cans than)."

77025,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"The good folks at ""Back to NATURE"" have put together an absolutely scrumptious granola offering.  It's so good that you can sit there with the open bag and snack on it handful after handful.  The granola is heavily punctuated with chunks of real dark chocolate.<br /><br />I wanted to try more of this before it was gone, but before I knew it my family had discovered and devoured the entire bag...and that's a good sign!<br /><br />I could also see adding nuts, perhaps almonds or cashews, maybe some M&Ms, and before you know it you'll have a super-fantastic trail mix...good for hiking or camping.  It's the sort of thing you could send out the door with your teenagers and be happy knowing that they are getting something that is good, and good for them.<br /><br />At the same time, this treat may deserve to be stashed away in your secret place for those times when you need something great for yourself.  Perhaps this granola is too good for kids to wolf down before they realize what they had.  You'll have to make the call on this one :-)<br /><br />Now why doesn't this product get 5-stars, with all that glowing praise?<br /><br />It's like this...this granola is pricey, pricey, and expensive!!!  That's the only reason this product misses out on the 5-star mark (at least for me).  Again, only you can judge whether your budget can handle an item like this.<br /><br />""Back to NATURE"", thanks for a great tasty treat!"
16879,B001LGGH40,5.0,"I was really pleasantly surprised with this drink. It's made from 100 percent fruit juices with no added sugar... and still tastes great. I was surprised that it does actually use the juices that describes the flavor. For example, this product actually contains real Kiwi and a blend of different berry juices. It's kind of a rare thing these days (since everything uses artificial flavors and sweeteners now)<br /><br />The only negative thing I can think of to say is that the bottles are too small.. only 8.3 ounces.  I wish they were at least... 10 ounces (preferably 12 :)"

The taste is light, refreshing, and with absolutely no chemical taste as some others have. Even without the energy boost, I'd drink this. (pardon the pun, but as to taste, there is ""no fear."")<br /><br />Energy? ""no fear"" there either. This does give a slight lift ... as good as other energy drinks I have tried, without any noticed drawbacks. Just watch the calories, as you should do with any similar drink."
129467,B001II47PW,1.0,"What a disappointment! First, this product should not have the name Bacon Salt. If you are familiar with the infused salts made for gourmet cooking with flavors such as thyme or rosemary, you will notice that this is a flavoring powder and not a salt at all. The predominant flavor is sort of a yeasty garlic and paprika with a small amount of smoke. There is practically no bacon flavor whatsoever. I tried the so-called natural product since I am allergic to monosodium glutamate. This product makes the claim ""No MSG Added"", but fails to inform the consumer that they have added autolyzed yeast extract instead. As anyone who is sensitive to MSG should know, autolyzed yeast extract itself contains free glutamates. It is a not so clever ruse to add MSG while claiming none has been added. Even the FDA is aware of this deception and has gone after a few of the larger offenders with truth in labeling claims.  [...]<br />My recommendation is that unless you cannot eat bacon, you might try preparing your own bacon salt at home. There are some great recipes for making things like bacon jam and spreads using real bacon and I am sure making a true bacon flavored salt would be a simple trick. The product concept is great, but the execution is horrible."

I added some ground cinnamon and nutmeg, and it corrected the flavor little bit."

I have been using the Sumatran for a while but it was not strong enough. This selection is a little stronger but it tastes like a bit more roasting is all that separates the two. If you use this for a travel cup (8oz or more), it will not be as flavourful. I found that this flavour ""grows"" on you and a work colleague of mine absolutely loves this one."

The popcorn itself is good and buttery, as described. If you are accustomed to the larger size bags, remember to adjust the time on your microwave to insure you don't burn it due to over cooking."

Wings - for the sauce butter, Crystal Hot Sauce (oh yes, it's the best, too!) Chipotle Tabasco, a squeeze or two of lime and some garlic powder or  fresh garlic minced...toss your wings in this and you'll be HAPPY! if you heat up the sauce first and then stir in the cold butter, it will thicken up and cling to the wings even better.

77643,B001LG940E,4.0,"When I got this product, I was a little disappointed that it was a small, skinny can of 8.3 oz.  But I wasn't disappointed with the taste.  It's very fruity and with the right amount of carbonation.  It's smooth, has a pleasant natural color, and it's packed with Vitamin C.  Although there is no sugar added, the sweetness comes from the fruit itself, which is still considered a form of sugar (fructose) so I wouldn't advise diabetics to drink Switch.  Switch Black Cherry is a winner, perfect for a quick pick-me-up. Although it's not as big a regular soda can, it's perfect for an older kid's lunchbox.  It's juice but with a kick!"

Pretty much every time, I dump about a scoop onto the counter.  Also, because the lid is attached, it ""swoops"" down and actually blows some powder out every time you close it.  Our counter top is always a mess, so I finally just got a secondary tupperware container.<br /><br />Also, it may be a fluke, but when they switched to this new package, my son had trouble keeping the formula down.  He may have had a bug, but I'm guess the change upset his stomach.  Only a few more months of bottles, but if we have another little one, we will be using Similac."

""Invented by researchers at Indiana University's School of Dentistry, the same researchers who developed flouride for you and me,"" DentaShield might be the sodium hexametaphosphate listed as the 5th ingredient after wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, and wheat germ meal.  It sounds like a salt, which isn't necessary to clean tartar from teeth, as the box claims.  Other ways are better to clean dogs' teeth.<br /><br />These biscuits are definitely loaded with non-essential ingredients like partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and artificial color (they're uniformly tan, so where's the color?).  The blurb about the same researchers who developed fluoride set off warning bells, as many people know the issues with mass amounts of fluoride in our drinking water, but people unfamiliar with those issues may feel this is a good advertising tactic.<br /><br />Our dog likes them, but dogs tend to like junk food, including human food.

77064,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"BACK TO NATURE'S CHOCOLATE DELIGHT GRANOLA tastes really good and has the perfect blend of crunchy and sweet that makes this a tasty snack, either as a cereal or right out of the bag.<br /><br />It's made from natural ingredients and doesn't contain artificial flavors, preservatives, hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />But here's the rub... the BACK TO NATURE CHOCOLATE GRANOLA, like all granola, is high in fat. Some of it is the good fat, Polyunsaturated and Monounsaturated, but it does contain 6g of total fat--2g of that Saturated Fat. It also packs 220 calories per 1/2 cup serving, which is about 2 1/2 handfuls, and it's very easy to keep eating it.<br /><br />Since opening the bag, I've probably eaten three servings already, because it's that good, but that can't be good for my waist!<br /><br />OK, I shouldn't be that harsh and deduct 1-star from BACK TO NATURE... for my own lack of will power, but many customers will see the words ""nature"" and ""whole grain"" and think ""healthy treat."" The small serving size of the granola is also deceptive because many will think ""this is such a tiny amount that I'll just eat a little more"" because it really does seem like you're eating a small amount, but then next thing you know you can't zip up your jeans.<br /><br />On the plus side, that means that the product is delicious but just be aware of serving size and portions. Otherwise, it's a good alternative to say a 180-calorie cookie that's full of high fructose corn syrup and sugar and no fiber."

I used the never-fail flaxseed egg replacement and put almond milk instead of cow's milk. The dough had a consistency reminiscent of seitan and was tough to roll and very greasy. The rolls cooked, sure, but they didn't change shape at all, were hard on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Really kind of nauseating. Wouldn't recommend this mix.. especially not for vegans."
81240,B001G7Q1PY,4.0,"Dilmah Green Tea is a medium-bodied tea, with only a little bitterness. The Jasmine flavor is not very pronounced, but I like the combination. (Overall, it is a good tea for around 4.00 a can. I used the promotional discount)"
158658,B001189I3A,3.0,"I've just started using this, so it is too early to say if it is firming under my eyes.<br /><br />However, I do really dislike the pump mechanism for this...it spits out 3 days worth of product, no matter how careful you are.  They need a pump that puts out far less or at least lets you control the output better."
152429,B000OQ4A3S,3.0,"I tried cocoa nibs during a recent chocolate tasting I attended so I expected the unsweetened, bitter quality of the nibs (taste). These, however, are a disappointment. The pieces are not consistent in flavor or texture from piece to piece (and the pieces are small). Some pieces have a vinegar-like undertone to the taste while others have the cocoa quality I expect. There seems to be a lot of shell fragments so I will need to re-process the pieces before using them in cookies. While the package says they are recommended for cookies, I wouldn't dare put these into a cookie dough without processing and close inspection. I received 2 shipments (one of which was the nibs) and then found a bug under the boxes so I can't tell where it originated (yuck). I thoroughly examined one package (I purchased 2) and found no critters so I plan to use them even though it means extra work for me. I don't suggest these for bakers."
127166,B000HDL1P8,1.0,"The one good thing that I can say about this mix is that it does produce a very large amount of soup. That's the only good thing that I can say. I have had this soup many times while living on Long Island. Been to Chinatown in NYC many times and<br />I can tell you this mix absolutely does not taste anything like Hot & Sour soup. I currently live in Orlando and have been here for about 10 years. I find this soup is inconsistent among the various Chinese restaurants here, so that is why I tried this product. After making one package worth of soup(?) and trying it, I threw out the remaining 5 packages of mix. Talk about false advertising. I need to find a book that will provide a correct recipe for this delicious soup so that I can make the soup from scratch."

I spotted a lone six-pack of Limonata sitting on the shelf of the water aisle.  For one fifth of the price I paid here."
153350,B000E46LYQ,3.0,"If you are looking for traditional jerky, you will want to order the slab style, which I would give 4 stars. High marks for hormone free and vegetarian fed. Their regular jerky is nothing like you would expect and I would only give it two stars, because the product description does not accurately reflect what you are getting. It is not thin, dried strips of buffalo. It is chopped up, extruded, and sliced into ""O"" shapes. If you look at the product packaging for their regular jerky, look at the letter ""O"" in buffalo. The name itself indicates that you have ""O"" shapes inside, but nowhere in the name or description is that mentioned. I'm sure many people will like this, but it's definitely not the ""jerky experience"" that most are looking for when they buy jerky."

It actually tastes REALLY good! I was very impressed! I've used it so far by itself on toast, and in a PB & J sandwich and I'm very happy with it. I get to enjoy peanut butter again for half the points!!!! If you're on a diet and love peanut butter, definitely try this! The first time I added too much water, which made it way too creamy, but since then I've lessened the water and it has a natural peanut butter consistency."

250554,B00248EA8Y,2.0,"This will be a combined review comparing two brands of maple candy I purchased on Amazon. I first bought the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248EA8Y"">Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Sugar Candy, 9-Ounce Box</a>.  It was one of the lowest price ones I could find, so I figured I'd try it first. The box was not totally sealed in plastic. The centers were a bit grainy - not creamy as I'd prefer. I would not recommend this product.<br /><br />Next I bought Mansfield Maple- 1 LB (16oz) Pure Vermont Maple Sugar Candy (48 Candies) [cannot add product link for some reason.] Now this stuff was wonderful! The box was not totally sealed in plastic, either, so I just put all of them in a sealed plastic container upon arrival. The outside was solid and the centers were creamy despite the packaging. The company bills them as ""Crystal Coated with Pure Maple to ""lock in"" the freshness... Made Fresh to Order."" That may be why they are perfect. I will keep buying this brand!"
76815,B0015Z3BT6,4.0,"My cat is, like those of the other reviewers, quite elderly at nearly 16 years old. In addition, for his whole life he has had what we thought was IBD. Diagnosed at the age of 2. A couple of years ago I changed vets and found out, to my surprise, that it wasn't so much an inherently bad case of IBD but a mild case of IBD that has been made worse by an allergy to grains!<br /><br />We got him stabilized and at a better weight than he's been at in years by switching to Acana food, but he still has bouts of irritation that make him vomit and lose weight rapidly when he can't and won't eat. It's really quite hard to watch since otherwise, he is a very strong and happy cat.<br /><br />Anyway, he had a particularly bad bout last year and we used KMR, Kitten Milk Replacer, to stimulate his appetite and get him some moisture and nutrition while he recovered. But that really isn't for a senior cat so I ordered this for the next bout.<br /><br />Sure enough, he started a small bout of it again a couple of months ago when he got hold of a pine needle someone dragged in on their shoe and I immediately began giving him this to help him hold it off.<br /><br />He loves this stuff and would drink it by the gallon if I let him. And it certainly worked to keep the calories up. But I noticed that after giving him this for a couple of days, approximately 2/3 of a can worth, he seemed to increase in nausea right after drinking it in any high quantity. I cut back and diluted it and he proceeded to heal as he did before using the KMR. There are no grains listed on the ingredients nor anything that I can think of that would act like a grain, but something in there doesn't agree with a sensitive tummy. It may simply be that it is too rich straight from the can for some kitties.<br /><br />If you have a cat with IBD, and I know there are a lot of them out there, I would highly recommend this, but I would suggest trying it diluted with water. It is an excellent supplement with all the right nutrients and is clearly very palatable to the cat sense of taste.<br /><br />It is a bit pricey and each can only lasts 3 days when open, but my vet suggested I freeze it in ice cubes in order to extend the life. I can't vouch for what that might do to the nutritional content. I did try that with some CatSure diluted 50/50 with water and once it was melted, my cat seemed to enjoy it just fine so I don't think the taste is changed negatively by it.<br /><br />I also recommend this as a very nice treat to the elderly kitty. They tend to absorb less nutrients and calories with age and this is a great way to make them happy and improve their physical lives."
17557,B000CMIYWM,5.0,"Yogi Teas are the highest quality--organic, earth-friendly, and flavorful. I prefer them to any other brand.

136574,B000VKA8V0,1.0,"Okay, I have tried several of this company's products and they are fair.  However, this one was shockingly bad.  The flavor was not just bland.  It was repulsive.

76975,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"I have tried Back to Nature products before and always been a little bit underwhelmed, but this product is pretty good.  The granola is not too sweet, which is perfect, and the dark chocolate chunks are great.<br /><br />I was also pleased by the amount of fiber and whole grains, though the product is also higher in fat (6g) and calories (220 per 1/2 cup).  Another plus, I could pronounce all of the ingredients.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bag contained mostly crumbles, so it may have been better eaten with a spoon than by hand.  I'm not sure if putting the snack in a box would have been any better at maintaining the larger clusters of snack or not.  (After all, my Kashi Go Lean Crunch cereal has nice clusters on the top and a bunch of tiny crumbles otherwise.)<br /><br />I could see taking this snack on a trip, as the bag size is not overwhelming and has a reclosable zipper top."

130926,B0038AXN30,1.0,"Bought this product based on the good reviews, but was utterly grossed out once I tasted it. It is beyond unpleasant and the chocolate flavor is essentially non existent. I am extremely disappointed."
123967,B003V8SQM2,1.0,"We could no longer find these chips at our local grocery store,so having them arrive at our door was sure was tempting. Shipment took longer than expected,about two weeks. When they finally arrived all of the different flavors were stale.  We have been working our way thru the box tossing them in our bags for lunches.  Too bad the cats aren't interesting in helping us out."
252887,B000BY50BY,2.0,I have ordered these before and was happy with them. They were long and usually curled length wise in sort of like a stick of cinnamon. The dogs enjoyed them with nothing left behind. This time I ordered 3 packages and they were flat shapes and irregular sizes. These shredded into small sharp shard-like pieces that looked decidedly dangerous and the dogs couldn't finish them. If they had tried I think these would have caused harm. At these prices I won't risk it again.
17195,B006JG8ALK,5.0,"I have been a bit disappointed with one of my favorite snacks the last year or two- Jennies Coconut Macaroons.  For some reason they just have not been as good as I have experienced for the last decade or more that we have enjoyed them. I was disappointed as so many companies have compromised the original purpose of making non sugar laden snacks, including using carob in place of chocolate.<br /><br />Jennies used to have both- using honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />Well, this past Christmas I got a package of Oskri Coconut bars.  I was not sure what to expect as the ingredient list is pretty simple- Brown Rice Syrup and Coconut!<br /><br />When i opened the first bar, it was complete excitement.  These bars are DELICIOUS.<br /><br />Not as overwhelmingly sweet like Jennies, these have a delicious sweetness that is subtle but fulfilling.  The bars are wrapped and very easy to eat.  Moistness is wonderful and the flavor is delightfully simple!<br /><br />I liked these so much that not only did I end up getting a subscription of them, but I found out my mother did so too!<br /><br />These are wonderful simple bars if you want a nice snack that is not overly sweet yet satisfying.  I highly recommend them."
128790,B0032GREWQ,1.0,"These new formula Potato Buds are horrible.  Betty Crocker changed the formula recently and the result is the worse instant mash potatoes ever, as compared to their original version that was the best in class.  Now the texture is sticky and gummy, and there is no potato flavor.  To make it even worse, there is a disagreeable aftertaste that remains for several hours.<br /><br />I strongly suggest trying a small box from your local store to try, before committing to this new version.  I think you will find that any other brand is better.  The change by Betty Crocker is a big mistake, and it will result in a loss of customer loyalty, including mine."

The coconut water in the 10oz cans taste sugary, almost syrupy.  Nothing like the 17oz cans of which I'm a huge fan.  I still have a few cans left of the 10oz and find myself adding tap water to dilute the sweetness of this product."
128802,B0032GREWQ,1.0,"I have noticed it seems to be getting harder and harder to find Potato Buds.  This new recipe is totally bogus.  I have contacted Betty Crocker and asked about Potato Buds being discontinued and I was told they had no plans to discontinue them.  What they failed to say is that they have completely discontinued the best instant potatoes in the world and are now selling some gummy, gooey mixture in the same packaging.  I have been a loyal customer of Betty Crocker's Potato Buds.  Until now, it was the only instant potatoes my children would eat.  I have tried and tried to make this new recipe work and it just doesn't.  It comes out crappy every time.  Now I am searching for a replacement instant potato.  Boo on Betty Crocker.  Boo."
241556,B000PJF7BS,2.0,"The point of this gum is to take one of the sours and one of the sweets and mix them together. Unfortunately, the sour strawberry tastes much better than the sweet, so although putting them together creates a decent flavor, I always end up throwing away the sweet pieces when chewing them one by one. Also, the flavor doesn't really last very long, and I find I can finish one box in one sitting."
124750,B0045X7H9A,1.0,"I thought I would give this one a try since it is cheaper by the ounce and has good reviews.<br /><br />I suppose it has a better outcome for others.

The other major brands did not do this to me.<br /><br />Red Rain is a huge disappointment for and I will not be investing in this one again."

17844,B0001FQVCA,5.0,"Nutella the amazing treat<br /><br />Are you a chocolate lover?  Well if you are, Nutella is what you want!<br /><br />Every day when I come home from school and have a banana I think ""well I don't want just a normal banana."" So I go to the cupboard and get some Nutella and boy is it yummy!<br /><br /> One of my most favorite thing about this product is it's smooth and creamy. It's  practically good on anything! One time I had it on a potato chip and it actually  wasn't that bad!<br /><br /> If you're on the go they sell little mini jars with crackers on the side, so your kids stay happy and entertained!<br /><br /> Another thing I love about is it is healthy for you so it keeps your kids happy and healthy at the same time!  Nutella is not like normal chocolate. it never melts and it stays good for quite some time. You know how some chocolate is a bad habit? Well this one is the complete opposite.<br /> If you're a chocolate lover this is the chocolate for you!"
156687,B0029JFZZU,3.0,"I have been looking for aspartame-free gum for some time until I found Xyla Gum. Flavor is fine, fresh and peppery, though I don't think it tastes like spearmint at all. My biggest issue with this gum is that it decomposes if you stop chewing because, say, you are talking to someone. I end up finding pieces of gum between my molars when I talk to friends, yuck! I will try to find other xylytol gum after I am done with the 12 packs."
77562,B001LG940E,4.0,"I got some of this, black cherry flavor, to try. My expectations were low, given that just about anything labeled ""black cherry"" that I have had at any time in my life has been pretty artificial tasting.<br /><br />Wow...what a shock! This stuff actually tastes like real black cherry juice. Very good flavor, nice mild fizz. I wish it were diet, but of course then it wouldn't have the flavor. I also wish the can were bigger, because it's GOOD.<br /><br />My main complaint is that this stuff, like just about every other canned/bottled juice, consists of a mixture of juices. There's cherry juice in there (thankfully...and trust me, that's not necessarily a given), but also cheapo apple and grape (typically used to keep costs down). Nonetheless, it actually tastes like cherry, so I can't complain too hard.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a bit different and better, try this for sure..."
17231,B00474G3BU,5.0,"What do fruit, brownies, and meat have in common? Yep the answer is they all go amazingly well with this chile lime seasoning. Sprinkling this stuff on top of wip cream is also a surprizing treat. Its great in a brownie batter, and is a wonderfull marinade for grillables. Its also perfect if you need to add a tart zing to a dish without adding any liquid. Toss french fries, chips, or any other fried foods immediately in this seasoning, after it comes out of the oil. It adds the acid that fried foods so desperately need, while still keeping them crispy. Who wants to mush up the batter with lime juice, well I use to, but not anymore?<br /><br />This seasoning will make you explore the boundaries of savory and sweet combinations (since it labeled itself a fruit seasoning), some will be delightful and others will be horrible failures. However, the experiences you will gain and the palette lessons you will learn from this magical seasoning are priceless.I liked the 8 pack because I saved on shipping with the amazon prime discount and also got to hand out 6 of them as gifts/party favors."
249433,B001LGGH54,2.0,"Well, I decided to share this with my daughters - 11 & 6 - apparently for my oldest daughter they sell this drink in her school. She loves it. Needless to say she was thrilled that I would get an opportunity to review it. I had never heard of it. So for a kids they loved it. Would I buy it, probably not. For such a small thin can, it has 140 calories. That's just too much! I would prefer they drink WATER! Good for the body and 0 calories. How about that?!  As an adult, I saw that although it is marketed as 100% natural, it did have 35 grams of sugar. Sugar is sugar - natural or artificial. I'll pass.  The kids give it five stars...and I give it two stars. So because mom is the actual reviewer, two stars wins."

132716,B0068RR59I,1.0,I have to say I am very disappointed in this deal. The merchant claimed he couldn't get a box from post office by the end of holidays. Now it's been more than two weeks after the holidays but the product was still not sent out. Made me think the merchant wasn't quite honest in this whole thing.
250168,B003DNL9YM,2.0,"Remember that old joke where one person says ""What flavor Kool-Aide is that?"" and the other person responds ""Red.""? Well that's kind of the situation here. This drink doesn't remotely taste of cranberry or apple, but it's not horrible tasting either. I most likely won't be reordering this, because I only tried it as an alternative to the more expensive Ocean Spray cranberry drink mixes and it appears you get what you pay for. I'll stick to Crystal Light for Iced Tea and Lemonade, which have always been excellent."
255983,B000CBOR60,2.0,I am a fan of gunpowder tea and have been for years. The flavor is about what I would expect from a gunpowder tea. The problem with this product is that the pellets were either broken or made up of leaf shreds instead of whole leaves and seem to lack the density I'm used to. Part of this may be that the packaging is a thin cardboard box and not a tin. I don't know if this is normal for the brand as it is my first purchase and probably my last. I'll try other new (to me) gunpowder tea marketers or go back to some of my tried and true brands.

Not suitable for in house use.<br /><br />My Chow loves to chew, and his favorites are IAMS Tartar Treats and Greenies.  Purchased the case of this GI Bone, at a very good price on Amazon (Entirely Pets).  Fast shipping from that Vendor. Good Vendor.<br /><br />The dog is proud of his bone, and occasionally carries it, but isn't chewing it much. Wish I purchased one at the store, instead of buying a whole case.

76863,B00002N8SM,4.0,"I've been nurturing a plant at work and it was doing so well I decided to repot to a larger pot. I must have gotten some funky soil because as soon as I repotted, we were being overrun by a large colony of small flies. I was swatting them and getting bug guts on my hand so frequently I stopped bothering with the ""gross!"" exclamations. The fact that in the city of San Francisco, you have to compost just aggravated the situation.<br /><br />I bought one of these nitfy traps and set it by my plant and voila! Instead of my hands getting the daily dose of bug guts, the trap is now lined with the tiny suckers! It's been a few months and the trap is pretty much covered (the gross part) and I need to order another one. Not sure how well this will work on larger inserts but it works really well on these tiny, annoying flies."
158712,B001189I3A,3.0,"I like the smell of the product, it's fresh. It seems a little greasy but I put it on at the end of the day after I have taken off my makeup and when I wake up it has been soaked up by my skin. I do not like the pump dispenser. One full pump and you unload enough cream for your entire face. You have to press down halfway on the pump to dispense the right amount. I was looking for a product that would reduce the amount of lines around my eyes, this one is supposed to make the area around my eyes look ""more awake and youthful"". I made the purchase because it says it's 100% pure and 100% natural. It wasn't very expensive so it was worth a try."
150737,B000O7Z71G,3.0,"I've purchased this product several time before, and never had this problem.<br />I currently am working on my first batch of a 2 pack shipment, so I'm hoping this problem doesn't continue.<br />The first 3 discs were ok, but the last 2 cups have had the tea leaves come out of the disc and into my cup.<br />The first time it happened I figured it out by getting a mouthful of them.  The second time, I watched the machine closely, and examined the disc afterward.  Seems like there is a production problem with the discs.<br />The disc gets very bloated, and the inside seal that keeps the contents inside, seems to fail.<br />I made some regular coffee immediately afterward, and didn't have any grounds seep out, so I think the problem is unique to these discs.  These are too expensive to have this happen even on one or two.<br />The product tastes WONDERFUL, but this problem is too serious too risk continued purchase of these."

236951,B007FS8AL6,2.0,I have bought this product a couple of times and really enjoyed it. BUT this last 2 bags has a weird smell and taste that seems stale or maybe chemical ish.

Every morning when I would make my coffee, it would never taste the same even though I always put 3 sugar packs in.  It slowly dawned on me that every single pack has a totally different amount of sugar in it!!!!!!!!  Some packs had about 20 grains (literally!!!) and some were so full, they burst when I tore them open.  WHat the (*&@!#(*!&@?!??!  Who does this? I started thinking that maybe the people who made the sugar were OVERPAID for their efforts and smoking a little too much hashish.  Although the taste of the sugar was great..."

151156,B001Q9EFW8,3.0,"I haven't had the same success as other reviewers here. My two sibling dogs are Rhodesian Ridgeback/Beagle mixes, and they are basically breathing vacuum cleaners. If it hits the floor, they eat it. I normally treat them to Stop & Shop brand treats in the assorted flavors (and colors) because they love them. The medium sized Hartz Crunch n Clean biscuits have been spit out repeatedly by my two 55 pound dogs. I even broke them in two to make them smaller for my dogs' mouths and they still reject them. It seems to be not only the size, but the fact that these biscuits are extremely hard. I'm sure that is what helps remove tartar, but my dogs only like a tough chewing job when they are enjoying a rawhide bone.<br /><br />On the other hand, the LARGE variety go over better, but not so much as quick treats but as if my dogs think I've just given them a rawhide to gnaw on. They're just in for a surprise when, after enough chewing of these hard bones, they actually break apart and become edible.<br /><br />Some of the main ingredients include wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, poultry fat, poultry digest, sugar, dried whey, malted barley flour, dried cane molasses, citric acid, corn starch, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.

I smell the cup when he places at my bedside table. I cannot describe exactly what I was tasting...Perfume...Chicory...something not so good. Down the drain it goes. Thinking we might need to make it stronger....maybe it will taste good this time??? NOPE. Down the drain. Rinse pot. Add our usual Starbucks Beans for the next pot in anticipation of a good cuppa and it still tastes like the awful vanilla. I've had to send the pot through its clean cycle now. Tomorrow we will try our regular beans again and hopefully we won't be reminded of that awful vanilla.....
238217,B003ZXE9QA,2.0,"I was tired of buying the same cereal for months (Chex Cinnamon, whichever Kashi was on sale, and whichever Honey Bunches of Oats were on sale), so I was looking for a new cereal product to try. Seeing as how other reviewers loved this cereal, I decided to buy it.<br /><br />When the cereal arrived, I was excited to give it a taste. I poured myself a bowl of fat free milk and got seated at the table. The cheerios-looking bits certainly looked very good, so I happily took a big spoonful of milk and cereal and delightfully took my first bite. Strangely, I could not taste the cinnamon. On top of that, the cereal left a very unsatisfying aftertaste (was this due to the antioxidants or the fiber?). I struggled to finish my cereal bowl, only managing to finish the bowl by reminding myself of the nutritional value it provided.<br /><br />I would give this cereal a 1-star rating, but considering it does contain a whole lot of fiber, I am bumping this to a 2. Now I am left with the challenge of finishing this box along with 2 others that I have bought. On the plus side, the boxes are smaller than the average Kellogg's/Post cereal found in stores, so I hope I can finish them faster.<br /><br />Edit: Okay, so I'm almost done with the first box with the help of my roommates. They tried it out and said it tasted fine. Then they tried it with milk and said the milk kind of ""washed"" away the taste. The only way I was able to enjoy this cereal with milk was by mixing it with some Kix that I had bought earlier.<br /><br />Edit 2: Done with all 3 boxes. I edited the titled to say that it tasted bland rather than just straight up bad. It's actually not bad at all; it tastes exactly as flavored - Cinnamon Oats. I'm not a big fan of oats, only eating it for its nutritional value, so I wasn't a big fan of this cereal."
18070,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"This stuff sounded too good to be true, but I tried it anyhow, and WOW am I glad that I did! I usually eat PB2 as a snack spread on a chocolate Vitatop muffin. I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar. The powder also tends to repel liquids, so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else. Start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture, then add the peanut powder/water mixture to your recipe."

If you're trying it for the first time, get the cap off and take it down FAST, before you can change your mind.<br /><br />Be careful (or maybe ask a doc) if you combine it with allergy meds. It claims to have no contraindications, but when taking it with cetirizine HCL (a generic OTC allergy medication), I found it resulted in dizziness. Nothing in the product should cause that reaction on its own, but perhaps one of the inactive ingredients interacts with the cetirizine HCL. Definitely wouldn't take the two together if I were flying -- it might contribute to motion sickness, and also there's the issue of unstable footing, if a person had to move about on the aircraft."

78405,B000LJHPIU,4.0,"I am lucky in that my 1 year Chihuahua isn't picky about his snacks and will eat just about anything. This product is no exception. I gave him one and he promptly took it to his favorite ""eating spot"" on the rug and went at it. I like the fact that it is low in fat and has somewhat natural ingredients as well as being good for the teeth. Since Chihuahuas can have dental problems, I am all for products that keep their teeth in good condition, since dental cleanings are quite expensive. Anyhow, he knows where his treats are kept and will eagerly anticipate getting one of these or some other tasty snack. Although it's made in China, my dog hasn't had any adverse reaction to the product. The product can get expensive but you can probably find a deal on it at your local pet store.

This is not one that I frequently see in the refrigerated drink section at the grocery store for some reason.  At $28/12 cans, that's about $2.33 each.  Comparatively, RB is $39.99 here on Amazon for the same quantity.  Unless you are a fanboi or just have to have that taste, this will cost less in the long run."

I have a rescue sheltie that was a junk-food junkie (not just grains, but candy in fact fed to him by his original owner) before I got him and needs to stay on healthy food for the sake of his weight and teeth.<br /><br />I wish I'd looked at the ingredient label before ordering this on Vine, this is not suitable for my dog, or anyone's in my opinion.<br /><br />Benefil does have beautiful packaging and an excellent top closure.

159501,B003SEB28O,3.0,"I am currently keeping my dog away from fowl and beef to see if I can clear up his tear stains a little, so I stopped feeding him his usual treats, after sorting through over a dozen non-fowl, non-beef and healthier type treats I found most had flour as the first and even 2nd ingredient. I don't totally object to flour, but his other treats have always been higher quality than that, so I'd prefer treats similar to those. So finally I came across Evo's Cravings, viola, first ingredient herring, and 2nd ingredient herring meal, and the rest of the ingredients are fabulous as well! And at a great price point, $6.89 in a store local to me. I know i love herring so I was hoping my dog would love it too, and indeed he does. The only problem is the last 20% of the treats ended up as pure dust, so consider these about 20% more expensive than the price, or the bag containing 20% less product. I did not like that, and unless I find them on sale to compensate for that 20%, i won't purchase them again.<br /><br />Awesome ingredients though:<br />Herring, Herring Meal, Peas, Pea Fiber, Pumpkin, Tomatoes, Sunflower Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols, a Natural Source of Vitamin E), Herring Oil, Apples, Carrots, Potassium Chloride, Cottage Cheese, Dried Chicory Root, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Chondroitin Sulfate, mineral (Zinc Proteinate, Iron Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Calcium lodate), Vitamins (Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin E Supplement, Betaine Hydrochloride, Vitamin A Supplement, Niacin Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Beta Carotene, Vitamin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Biotin, Folic Acid, Phylloquinone)"

I understand that in packaging there would be a certain amount of settling of the product at the bottom of the bag but what i received was almost 2 inches of product dust and small granules.

160378,B001EO5SW6,3.0,"... in his famous Dictionary of 1755, when he defined ""oats"" as a grain eaten in England by horses and in Scotland by people. Well, I guess I'm not Scottish. I've never regarded hot oatmeal as more than a cruel necessity of back-packing, and I've hated cold bran flakes -- honestly, all cold cereals -- since I was a child accustomed to Swedish cheese-and-herring breakfasts. But I'm adaptable. When I lived in Japan, I learned to 'relish' cold rice, raw egg, and dried seaweed for breakfast. It was easier in Spain, where hot chocolate and churros for dunking, in my neighborhood cafeter&iacute;a, seemed quite an elegant solution to the problem of mornings. Best of all was Italy: a huge bowl of caffe latte and a couple of croissants! But wait! Mexico was breakfast heaven: huevos rancheros, fried eggs on black beans and tortillas with melted cheese and hot sauce!<br /><br />Yes, I've had to confront the curse of mornings in a lot of environments, but now I'm living in the strangest realm of all: mortality, to which I hold the civic rights of senior citizenship. And I'm striving to be responsible, eating closer to my small share of the world's nutritional resources. Oat bran is reputed to reduce cholesterol - mine is unexpectedly high now - and to support a healthy colon. Well, a healthy colon is nothing to scoff at, in every way superior to a colon burdened with diverticula as labyrinthine as the intellectual diverticula of life in the USA.<br /><br />These Arrowhead Mills Oat Bran Flakes are 100% unsugared, unflavored, unadulterated horse food. I like that in a cereal to be eaten for duty rather than pleasure. Mixed with blueberries or raspberries, they're acceptably neutral, like the gesso on a painter's canvas before the pigments are applied. But you have to eat them quickly! Don't even try to read the sports page until you've gobbled them down! If they get soggy in the milk, they become as repulsive as canned spinach or truck-stop mashed potatoes.<br /><br />Are they effective for reducing cholesterol? I can't say. I bought my 'Pack of 4' and consumed my daily portion until the last box was empty, but that was probably not a long enough test trial to certify or decertify the product. On the other hand, I can testify to their utility for weight loss; I had no temptation to gobble a second bowlful."

They have been eating it for months, so it isn't just the transition to new food.  Maybe all the veggies?  I also notice that they do not digest the carrot pieces at all.  But a natural food is way better than what they used to eat, so we are sticking with it for now."

241310,B001Q54R7K,2.0,"I seldom enjoy Kona coffee because it is so expensive.  But it is outstanding coffee.  I prefer whole beans that I grind myself just before brewing, using a burr grinder set on coarse.  Then I carefully brew it using a French press with hot water between 180 and 200 deg. F.  Then, after four minutes brewing, I pour a cup, add a touch of fresh cream, and I am set!<br /><br />This Christmas while visiting Hawaii, my sister-in-law bought a pound to give to me.  What a nice surprise!  But when I ground the coffee I got a tremendous amount of chaff.  It made a mess in our kitchen, blowing all over the counter and floor!  Having roasted my own coffee beans at times, it appeared to me that either the chaff was not removed during roasting and processing, or the beans were not roasted properly.  The taste of the Kona coffee was flat and disappointing.  Buyer beware; make sure you can get it returned or replaced if you are not satisfied."

237732,B00337P71Y,2.0,"Have I owned one of this make and model?  No.  But I have owned 4 or 5 of the Webber units that are essentially the same design.  I have also owned 8 or 10 of the probes that stick into the meat.<br /><br />The thermometers are great when they work.  They are so good that, even knowing the design flaw, I keep buying them and replacement probes.<br /><br />The receivers and transmitters all work well and seem to have an expected long lifetime.  The probe is the Achilles heel in every make and model of wireless thermometer.  Within the metal, flexible shielded cable that runs from the probe to the transmitter are small wires.  Small weak wires.  Small fragile wires.  Small worthless wires due to their failure rate.<br /><br />If the user closes the lid of the BBQ or smoker on the metal shielded cable between the probe and the transmitter, the internal wires WILL fail.  It may take 2 or 3 times, but they will fail.  If the metal shielded cable is kinked or bent too sharply, the internal wires will fail.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I was on the Webber customer service line (again) requesting a new probe because the wires failed.  I asked the customer service representative if she owned one of these wireless systems and, to my surprise, she said ""Are you kidding?  I would NEVER own one of these"".  I asked her why and she said ""I have a full time job, 7 days a week taking calls just like this one -  people complaining 8 hours a day, 7 days a week because the probe failed"".<br /><br />Now, if I were her boss, I would have fired her on the spot.  From a consumer's point of view I found this conversation somewhat alarming.<br /><br />This summer I will probably buy another and attempt to keep the smoker's lid from crushing the tiny worthless wires - but eventually I will fail and so will the probe.<br /><br />In short, this is a great product with a major and easily correctable design flaw.  Be prepared that the wires within the shielded cable can and will fail."

168921,B0016BAB42,3.0,"------------ Product Review 5 Stars -------------<br />The powder is good and cheap (compared to other brands), and tastes great in my smoothie.  A 5-star product for sure!  It needs to be refrigerated after opening and is good for 60 days.  The scoop is over twice as big as the scoop that came in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q1SYNQ"">Perfect foods Acai Powder</a>, so although the Sambazon Acai Powder costs less (and is just as good), the price probably comes out to be close to the same if you use the huge Sambazon scoop.<br /><br />If celebrity endorsements matter to you, Alton Brown recommends using the Sambazon brand acai juice. Since he's a food scientist, you can be sure he's researched his product.  Although he's not using the powder, the fact that he specifically uses Sambazon, gives me some greater comfort in using it because apparently, not all acai products are equal.<br /><br />------------ Seller Review 1 Star --------------<br />I hate it when people review the seller and not the product in this area, but this seller violated one of the MAJOR reasons I use Amazon. Also, there was not enough room in the seller review area for me to warn other folks, and trust me, you need to be warned.  So here it is...<br /><br />I enjoy using Amazon because I don't get put on junk email lists by sellers.  After buying this product, I received a non-Amazon email from the seller requesting my feedback.  I've been an Amazon customer for over 10 years and this is the first time I've experienced this kind of solicitation.  I'm now finding myself having to go to a non-Amazon website, [...] requesting to be removed from their marketing.  Are you serious?  Subscriptionloop.com?  That should send chills up your spine!  God only knows who has my email address now.  If you hate spam, the potential for spam, or don't want a company called subscriptionloop.com to have your email address, avoid this seller at all costs.  As most of us know, it only takes one mistake with your email address and then it's spam city.  I fear that I have made that mistake by using this seller.<br /><br />**Note: When I purchased this product in Feb 2012, it was being sold by Beepco llc (Sun Light Savings).  It now shows that it's being sold by Amazon, and if that's the case, then you shouldn't have my experience.  If it changes to Sun Light Savings though, you've been warned...**"

237078,B004ZU0RAE,2.0,"this is an amendment to an earlier review.<br />we have been using these bottles for a few weeks now and it's become clear that our bottle brush does not reach all around the bottom of the bottle.  i suppose i could stuff a rag down there and use a butter knife to try and clean it but i don't have time for that kind of thing.  our son has developed a preference for the nuby wide mouth bottle with handles and the vari-flow nipple (we were trying 4 different bottles as we moved up from 4 oz to 8 (or 10 or whatever) oz bottles) anyway, so we have ordered more of those and are not going to use these any longer.<br /><br />below is the original review.<br />we have been using these bottles for about a week now and are very pleased.  these bottles make it very easy to feed baby in a more upright position.  we have not had any problem with swallowing air or with nipple collapse.  i find the indentations on the side really do make it easier and more comfortable for me to hold the bottle.  i like that this bottle does not have any extra parts to wash, unlike some other bottles designed to reduce air ingestion.  my baby (five months old, using bottles for 3 months now) has not had problems adjusting to any nipple we've tried and he took to this nipple with no problem.  we did order more nipples in the medium flow rate, as these come with a slow flow nipple and our baby is starting to get frustrated with those.  i love that they are bpa free.  i was a little concerned they may be difficult to clean, but they are not.  likewise, it is not harder to put the formula in them; just turn the bottle so the opening is facing your hand.  i give these 4 stars and not five mostly because they do not have handles.  my baby really wants to hold his own bottle (some of the time) and these bottles are too big for him; he just can't wield them.  we have other bottles that do have handles and he just loves that.  also, while i have no problems with the bottle itself leaking (just be sure not to screw nipple on too tightly or loosely), the nipple (the medium flow more so) does drip when bottle is held upside down or on it's side.  on that note, the lids do not touch the nipples when on; so if you shake your formula in the bottle you do have to touch nipple with your fingers.  all in all this product was just what it said it would be and we are very happy with it."

127697,B001BOVE54,1.0,"I got my 2 kittens about a year ago (June 08) and started them on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFEMHK"">Innova EVO Cat and Kitten Dry Cat Food (15.4-lb bag)</a>. They both enjoyed EVO and the ingredients are very similar to what is in CORE. But I decided to give Wellness Core a try now that they are older because EVO has a higher fat content and more calories and I didn't think they would need as much fat content now that they are about a year old.<br /><br />They seemed to like the taste of CORE just as much (maybe even a little more), but I will say that CORE has a much stronger, fishier smell than EVO. Also, a 12lb. bag of CORE is about the same price as a 15.4lb. bag of EVO, so CORE winds up being more expensive. Though it is more convenient to just go to PetCo to buy the CORE than it is to go to the specialty feed store to buy EVO.<br /><br />Bottom line: both are excellent dry cat foods, and I will probably wind up rotating between them. Since they are outdoor cats, I plan on feeding them EVO as the weather gets colder so they can build up a layer of fat for the winter, and Core when it's warmer and they don't need as much insulation.<br /><br />UPDATE (10/21/2012): One of our cats started having urinary tract problems. After doing some research online, I found a number of people using this cat food that have complained about urinary problems caused by this food. We have since switched to a different brand (Orijen) and the urinary crystals have gone away."

If you go to the Bell Plantation site, the company that makes this stuff, there are lots of recipes that look appetizing. My only problem with this powdered peanut butter is that it's just not as satisfying as the real stuff because there's no (or not much) fat in it . So sometimes it's hard to only eat a little like you would with normal peanut butter. But the taste is very natural, not fake tasting in any way, and I loved it!"

While not great it was pretty good and had minimal aftertaste. That sets it apart from other energy drinks I've tried, and I've tried just about all of them. If you like this type of product then this is definitely worth a look. I checked the label and there wasn't any specific flavor listed so I guess there's only the one."

The package arrived within the estimated date and in great condition.  However, the flavor was blah.  The toffee coating was horrible - no taste at all.

77479,B001ELJK82,4.0,"I have been making kit wines for nearly 15 years so I have a bit of experience with this topic.  I have made kits from all the major brands.<br /><br />This kit has had me puzzled from day one.  First impressions were that it would be an 'OK' wine but nothing special.  As fermentation and aging progressed, opinions ranged from 'pretty good' to 'big mistake'.  Aging makes a HUGE difference with these wines. During the first 3 months in the bottle, the wine was undrinkable - very harsh with horrible aromas.  Then, at about 3 months, it turned the corner to a very nice table wine.  This will never pass as the best wine you have ever had but, as a table wine, it is worth every penny paid and then some.<br /><br />I made a second batch using filtered water, adding oak in primary and secondary and using BM4x4 yeast and have been very pleased with the results.  Became an above average table wine.<br /><br />All in all, buy one of these and give it at least 3 months in the bottle before passing judgement.  I think you will be pleased.  I'm going to try a Barolo next and then possibly try one of the 16 liter Chateau Classico kits.  These are fun."

The food was steamed, but the blade doesn't turn because the motor isn't engaging the turning knob. Not worth my time to fix a machine that never worked. Will get the Baby Cook instead.<br /><br />OK, update on this product. I found a blog by searching for the product name in Google and something like ""blade doesn't turn"" and found a fix-it explanation that worked great. Another review on Amazon also has the way to fix this. So after taking 15 minutes to find a good fix, and 10 minutes of taking apart, fixing the band that connects the motor to the blade axis, and putting it back together, the Brezza works great. We have made all kinds of foods in the Brezza including carrots, apples, broccoli, pears, peas. All these items streamed well and pureed well too. However, we still do yams and squash in our immersion blender because the brezza seems to have a little trouble with those items.<br /><br />I'd give it four stars but I took off one for the fact that I had to fix it upon arrival. I hope the company has indeed altered it's design to stop the bands from slipping off during shipping."

Now they won't eat it (after a couple of bags).  I have tried both flavors and they refuse it.  I don't know what has caused them to reject the food, but since I have more than ten cats and ALL refuse the food, it must be the product.  There was no problem with litter box odor and the change in their appearance was positive.  I am still looking for another product. By the way, the cost of the premium food is worth the improvement in the cats' appearance and decrease in litter usage."

77376,B0009QT6UK,4.0,"Kuding translates to ""bitter nail"" and honestly that really tells you a lot about the taste.  I drink this tea really from the perspective that you don't drink this tea for the taste, but the health benefits.  My knowledge on traditional medicine is really limited so I'll not go into it so that I'm not misleading anyone - but effectively this tea is supposed to help with too much body heat which manifests in a few different ways.  Drinking this tea tends to ""cool"" your body down and is supposed to help balance the fact that most people's diets do not include much that is bitter.  I found personally that after drinking this tea I tend to sweat less, and it helps me feel better.  The taste is something that will throw off most people, so I wouldn't advise this to most, it's incredibly bitter, but if you start with one nail and work your way up, you won't be overpowered.  The other thing is drink this tea while it's hot, it makes it much more bearable."

It is very sweet just as it is but after reading the ingredients list, I understand why it's so sweet.  The 3rd ingredient is sugar, the 6th is brown sugar, and down on the list is dextrose, malt flavoring, and honey.  Of course raisins are high in sugar too.  Though I thought the almonds, raisins, whole grain wheat, cinnamon, and wheat bran along with the long list of vitamins and minerals in it made this a really healthy breakfast choice, I have to rethink that opinion.  After eating this and then testing my blood sugar shortly afterwards, I realize this is definitely not a cereal for diabetics.

77870,B001LG940E,4.0,"There are many things to like about the Black Cherry Switch drink.  I found the taste to be very good.

The reviewer who stated that it tastes like a Jolly Rancher is spot on.<br /><br />There is a hint of watermelon flavor, but it is drowned out by excessive sweetness. I kept wondering where the strawberry flavor was. It never materialized. The overall flavor is one-dimensional. Reading the ingredient list clues you into the fact that it has more apple/pear/grape juice than watermelon or strawberry. That probably explains why it's rather boring tasting.

76504,B001O2F6B6,4.0,GREAT PACKAGING.  EASY TO HANDLE AND OPEN PLASTIC BOTTLES.  A GOOD NATURAL TASTE AND WORKS WELL IN SMOOTHIES. WOULD CONSIDER PURCHASING AGAIN FOR THE SAME PRICING.
246137,B0000D9N9S,2.0,"Wonderful cheese but........Ordered the cheese and when I got it the expiration date was one month out and even immediately, it had a bad flavor.  I love the cheese but won't order again from this site.  I emailed them with the problem but they never answered.  Guess the company doesn't care."
78885,B000HK9IKG,4.0,"Dieting means I don't get to enjoy a lot of my favorite foods. Chocolate milk is one thing I hadn't tasted in months and was resigned to forgoing for years. (I have a lot to lose.) But this chocolate stevia adds zero calories to the milk, and I really enjoyed the chocolate milk I made with it. It still isn't something I'll be able to drink often, as 1 cup of 1% milk is 110 calories by itself, but I'll at least be able to enjoy it occasionally.<br /><br />When reading any stevia product review, remember that people ""taste"" sweetness differently. Some people don't really taste stevia as sweet, while others find it *too* sweet. In addition, I noticed that some stevia products, like this one, were both flavorful and sweet, while others tasted (to me) like there was no sweetener in it."
256518,B003JA5KBW,2.0,"I was very underwhelmed with this product for several reasons.<br /><br />1) It's caffinated. Caffine actually gives me migraines and there was nothing on the Amazon description to indicate this. It's also odd for a powdered drink supplement like this to have that. This thing packs as much caffine as a cup of coffee and I actually had to go to the Eboost website to discover this as the packaging doesn't say so. Very uncool.<br /><br />2) This doesn't taste at all like an Acai Pomegranate drink. It tastes more like a generic fruit punch product.<br /><br />3) Very foamy. This plus the colour of the product reminded me of something out of a Jeffrey Combs film.<br /><br />4) I'm not really sure why the tagline of the product is ""For the Planet,"" when it doesn't do anything green or ecological. In fact, the 30 count box involves 30 little pouches you'll be throwing away (but they are recyclable) so it's actually less ""green"" than something like Crystal Light where you can scoop the flavoring out.<br /><br />I can't honestly think of anything positive to say about the product other than it is a nice source of zinc, chromium, copper and selenium, but even then you're getting those as strange chemical compounds rather than in fashion you would normally intake them.<br /><br />Definitely pass on EBOOST. Nice idea, but bad follow-through."
166395,B004725P6G,3.0,"They came in great shape, dispite the extreme heat of day, but I can imagine they would have melted if left outside in summertime. They tasted ok, but certainly not worth a second time around, they can get tired after six boxes. I have had better marshmellow cookies."
236070,B002GWMCEW,2.0,"I ordered carmel flavored coffee from several online sites; this coffee was the best of the bunch, but, while all the coffees were of quality, I wasn't satisfied with the 'carmelness' of any of them.....and I specifically want 'carmel flavored coffee'."
158703,B001189I3A,3.0,"I bought Pure Cosmetics Coffee Bean Eye Cream back in May 2011, took a month's break from it in Sept, but have gone back to it. The results weren't mind-blowing when I was using it daily from May through mid-September, but I used it anyway because it's better than nothing. To be honest, I like how it moisturizes better than other eye creams and gels that I've used. I apply it under concealer for hydration and protection from whatever stressful effects cosmetics and living/working in NYC has had on my dry-to-sensitive skin. I used it without make-up for most of the summer to give my skin a break, but I saw no firming or brightening effects... just moisturized/hydrated. As I stated before, it's better than nothing.<br /><br />The ""coffee bean"" scent is indescribably NOT coffee, cookie, or cocoa... maybe a light version of a box of soggy waffle cones? I highly recommend you smell this at a store before you buy it. It's a super soft and creamy scent, yes, but still distinct and unappealing to me. It's basically become a general and accepted reflex to hold my breath for the few seconds I dab this on. I'm still using it because its moisturizing ways are worth it. Plus, I love the pump... it's a welcome relief from jars and tubes.<br /><br />I don't expect results from this, now that I've gone back to using it, but it feels good under my eyes: no irritation, whatsoever (i.e. my eyes don't water or itch when I dab it on my skin); moisturizing/hydrating; and very light and smooth.<br /><br />Basically: It's better than what I've previously used. However, no life-changing results... but better than nothing."
237878,B000JSQBK6,2.0,Candy came as though someone just grabbed a handful of bars and shipped them out in a carboard box. I thought British candy would taste better but this Kit Kat taste as though it has less sweetness than the American version. I would save my money and buy local instead.
80238,B002C58RXI,4.0,Good price for Community Coffee pack of 3.  Received quickly.  Product packages were sealed but not firm bricks like I expected. I will say that the flavor was not compromised by that.  Will probably order these again.
235796,B001F10XUU,2.0,"This stuff is barely acceptable. I have some Starbucks Tazo Matcha powder and thought this might be a close match in flavor. But, it's really funky tasting. I'd describe the taste like a cross between grass clippings from a lawn mower and a really strong fishy taste. I know the Starbucks Matcha has sugar mixed in there but even still, with a pound of sugar and cream you can still easily taste that fishy flavor. I pretty sure I would not buy again. BUT, the seller shipped it VERY fast and there were no problems otherwise."
247207,B001E5DWWI,2.0,"When I purchased this item, I was under the impression that the oil was in fact cold pressed oil. When I received the item it says Roasted on the can, I am very unpleased with the product as I needed this oil for facial cleaning. Amazon's customer service number or contact information is hidden to patrons and I feel that it is quit sneaky. I attempted to try to return the item and I have still not received my password reset that I sent almost five days ago which would have put me within the 30 day window to return. I have never been unpleased with an item before but I have made note of this issue for future online purchases from Amazon."

126754,B003IHO8LE,1.0,"The tag line on the back of the bottle sold me-- it was something like, ""what's wrong with wanting to feel happy?"" I was feeling blue, and thought maybe trying something new would make me feel better, even if the drink didn't.<br /><br />I drank about a 1/4 of the bottle. It tasted pretty good ! But then five minutes later got a BAD headache. I wound up going to bed early,  woke up the next day and STILL had the headache.... and it stayed with me almost all day!!  I NEVER get headaches!<br /><br />I never use energy drinks, so maybe I'm sensitive to it,  but it didn't seem to me that this was even advertised as an energy drink-- it's just vitamins, right?  But I'm definitely not trying Neuro drinks again-- I'll stick to my usual vitamin supplement. Time is too precious to risk being crippled by a headache!"

Items came pretty beat up and the cereal boxes where damaged but the internal sealed packages where ok. Probably gonna be quite a few crumbs in there. The packaging wrap around the pack of six was quite dusty and I was worried that the items where outdated but still good for a few more months, enough for me to eat them in time before expiration date is met."

163468,B0002QX3Q0,3.0,"What was I THINKING???  Of course these cause stinky gas.  Don't you have that when you eat deviled eggs on the holidays?  I love the Charlee Bear Dog treat line, however, I have to get rid of my 16 ounces of treats because my yellow lab is continually passing gas when I have given him these.  Labs are notorious for stomach issues, so it could be that, but I won't get this flavor again."
158727,B001189I3A,3.0,"After reading the reviews I was highly excited to try this product.  But, unfortunately, I'm a little disappointed.  Being a mid to late 20's girl, I really just wanted something to help with my dark circles and hold up the aging process a little bit via fine lines starting to form around my eyes.  I love the texture and thickness of this cream.  It really does absorb well and isn't creasy at all.  But, it smells like playdough, not coffee-ish, or cocoa-ish even.  I haven't noticed an improvement at all.  I've been using it for 3 weeks now, so something should've shown by now.<br />I do have to say, that the ingredients are listed right on the bottle, and it doesn't get any better than organic everything, pretty much.  Just wished it worked better for me!"

This is another movie i brought and sold with in days. The idea of the story is not bad but this kid is talking to the devil through a computer. I dont know the movie just sucked , IMO atleast. What i would advise anyone to do is rent it b4 you buy it or find it used for like 6$ so if you dont like it atleast you only spent $6 instead of 15 or 20 $."
248461,B00016LZT8,2.0,"A long time ago, Burger King had this little promotion going on that had a little packet of cheese powder that came glued to a paper bag with your order so you could dump your fries in, add the powder, and shake the bag up and coat the fries in cheesy decadence.<br /><br />I've been trying to find the equivilent of these packets on the market. This wasn't it. Not only was this NOT it, this isn't a very user friendly product, and it's uses are very linear.<br /><br />>The powder will NOT work in any sort of shaker, unlike the cheese powders you see for popcorn. This makes dispensing the powder a little annoying because it pretty much as to stay in the bag.<br /><br />>While it does taste like cheese when you dap a bit on your finger, the flavor ends there when added to any foods (in a moderate amount)<br /><br />>Tossing it with anything wet/fried with result in large clumps of cheese gathering at the bottom with less than 5% of what you used actually sticking to your food.<br /><br />>Adding it to soups for flavor proved to be just as problematic because the powder mimics the old ""Ovaltine"" habit of clumping up in little bubbles of itself and won't mix in.<br /><br />Basically, this product has only one real intended use it seems: if you want to make your own macaroni and cheese that tastes just like Kraft, here's the powder in bulk form. Still need butter and milk.<br /><br />So I suppose if you are REALLY pinching pennies, this is a cheaper alternative to an already cheap meal. But there is no diversity whatsoever and to me, that's disappointing enough to keep me from ever ordering more."
235388,B001463GD2,2.0,"Not much to tell here, the pieces were discolored in the bag, appeared to have been in bag for longer than normal, I buy these whenever I see them in stores, never seen the pieces dicolored before. Also, a bit hard, not as ""fresh"" as usual. Wouldn't buy them sight unseen again"
16474,B000F9XBDE,5.0,"I wasn't expecting much, having found a box of these for $2 at Big Lots , but they're actually quite tasty. Most of the boxes were pretty dented, so I suspect that's why they ended up at the close-outs store). I thought I'd have them all to myself, but it turns out all three picky eaters like them, too--probably due to the pizza like flavor with the crunchy cracker appeal that kids can't resist."
158479,B000EDMEHK,3.0,"Won't purchase these again.  Fine for adding crunch to salads.  These could have used a light salt or other seasoning, then would have been a better tasting snack."

16440,B007TJGZ54,5.0,This is a great tasting Breakfast Blend. I have been drinking it every since I purchased my new coffee maker. I will be buying more of it in the near future. Great way to start my stressful day.
150124,B001EO7MZW,3.0,"The seasoning is terrible. You can doctor it however, but do not, I repeat, do not use it by itself. It seriously tastes like dried grass. I'm sure if you use it in a vinaigrette, or some other concoction it'd add a nice element. Alone, is tastes like crap."
79916,B0000D958O,4.0,"I found if you add a little bit of splenda and some vanilla or maple extract, that you can make this mixer taste just like a regular pina coloda!<br />The next best flavor they make would be the lemon mixer, but the rest of the  mixes are a bit tough on the pallet...."

Soon as I tried it, I said that it was too good to be true.  And it wasn`t.  My advice to you:  get your kids to the dentist cause their teeth are gonna fall out after eating all of that sugar.  No doubt your kids are hooked and addicted to sugar now."
79025,B005NS6LRK,4.0,"These are probably the best hot chocolate I've had at home. Very rich flavor and relatively low in calories (under 120 a packet, I think). Love all the flavors."
237630,B001CHFSR0,2.0,"I ordered a sample pack that had five of these in it. Thank goodness. I would think long and hard about purchasing this one without trying it first. There's not a lot of chocolate flavor to it (I was looking for more of an alternative to a Cafe Mocha). I added some cream and sugar which helped a bit, but on its own, this one's pretty gross."

157136,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"I'm not a fan of flavored coffee, but the hazelnut flavor was balanced well and didn't get overpowering after the second (third, fourth then fifth) cup. My only issue was that the coffee is quite weak - and I'm comparing this again Peet's standard brew blend and Costco's ubiquitous-but-cheap Kirkland Signature coffee. If you enjoy flavored coffee to taste more like the flavor that the coffee, this may be a good choice, whereas if you prefer a hint of flavor then you may be wondering where the coffee went."
17224,B006K02VJC,5.0,"I agree with the other reviewers that the chocolate can be a tad crumbly, but this only occurred with my first order, and the taste of these bars is still absolutely AMAZING!!<br /><br />These bars are gluten free, have three basic ingredients (coconut, rice syrup, dark chocolate), and are a wonderful treat that I don't feel terrible after eating.  Try a box and you'll soon find out how incredibly delicious they are."
156198,B001E6K6G2,3.0,My entire family used to eat only Basic4. For last 8-12 months we tried few different ones but again ordered this from Amazon. It didn't taste as good as before. Either GM has altered the proportions or it was a bad batch. It has got more puffed rice and less fruits and nuts. We didn't like it as much as we used to love it.
81698,B001VDXO3K,4.0,"If you like coconut water, this is for you! I had bought this product at a local market to try, while having chemo. Turns out the more i drank, the more i wanted! It has potassium in it, and some chemo makes you potassium deficient. So, i felt better drinking this product,along with lots of water, to say hydrated."
161641,B001EO6FKK,3.0,"You get more for your buck with this brand over another I bought thru Amazon grocery which is no longer available, but it is less dense.  It does the job, though, and I like it."

245848,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"Orders have always arrived on time. I've ordered the 24-count ""variety pack"" a few times now. I was a bit suspect the first time when they arrived in a brown paper bag, stapled at the top, with a printed bar code on it. I don't know why, but that was more acceptable to me than the 1-gallon ziplock bag of K-cups I received this time - this time with only 23 K-cups in it, not the 24 I paid for. I suppose you could say that the ziplock will keep the coffee ""fresher"", but even the manufacturers ship K-cups in cardboard boxes since cups are already sealed. I realize this company/person probably purchased many individual flavors of coffee and is creating a hand-made mix of all of them to create the variety pack that doesn't really exist. But after this last purchase I think I'm done. I actually care less about receiving 23 instead of 24 cups, although nobody likes to get less than they paid for. It's the minimalist packaging and ""made in my basement"" look of the packaging that has done it for me."
243442,B00305L330,2.0,Didnt like this flavor.  Too sweet for me.  Using one scoop and putting in my regular coffee to use it up.
154391,B004EI6FAI,3.0,"These bars are an excellent source of fiber and a very convenient way to fit more into your diet.  At 12 grams of fiber per bar, just one bar will put you well on your way to meeting the daily suggested amount.  However, the taste isn't that great.  They are dry and very dense.  I wouldn't mind the heaviness of the bar, if the manufacturer could find a way to make these a little more moist.  I felt like I needed a whole glass of milk to go with it just to be able to chew and swallow.  My taste buds didn't detect much of a chocolate taste either.  I think that the Banana Walnut and Apple Cinnamon cereal bars, while also dry, have a better flavor than the Brownie bar."
249512,B001LGGH54,2.0,"This flavor (Watermelon-Strawberry) of the Switch carbonated juice is pleasant, but has an ""interesting"" after taste.  It leaves a flat feeling in the mouth. I didn't feel refreshed, it was just sort of there. I didn't think, ""Oh wow this is great"", it's not.  Slightly tart but not to the point of pucker. It doesn't really taste like watermelon or strawberry. Given grape and apple juice come before the listed flavors that's not surprising. The color is a pale orangey-pink sort of like watermelon but not really.  Fair at best."
251425,B004H3N2LU,2.0,"While the taste of the coffee itself is acceptable for the most part, several of the cups did not work properly and I was unable to get them to brew.  I also found it interesting that on the ones that DID work...when the water went through it in the brewer, initially the stream of coffee was very, very dark and then it turned to water.  Made it seem like there was something similiar to instant coffee in there...<br /><br />Anyway, while it seemed a good price initially, I won't be purchasing this brand again."
17921,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"PB2 is AMAZING!!!  Whoever thought you could eat peanut butter without all the fat and calories?  I don't know how they did it, but they managed to remove the bad stuff and still have a product that tastes just like the real thing!

I drank it so much that I used to buy it in bulk directly from them. When this tea arrived I quickly brewed up a cup and couldn't believe it was the same tea! The flavor was overwhelming, jarring, not subtle. Maybe this is the last stash that has aged poorly. Anyway, if you like Harney & Sons' Midsummer's Peach this won't be your nostalgia tea."
17563,B000CMIYWM,5.0,"This Yogi tea flavor doesn't really have the strong flavor like Peach Detox or Women's Energy just to name a few. This tea has the Lavender smell. OMG! The fragrance can linger for a long time in my mouth and throat after drinking this tea. Just make me feel so good and calm. YES! Just soothing and relaxing. My 70 year old mother who is usually picky on her tea choices, I let her try this tea when she visits. After a cup, she told me - hum.. Get me more, this is good and I want to share with my circle of friends. This tea is ""Mother proves""!"

18077,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"I really like this product!  I first read about it in my Diabetic Living magazine and since I love peanut butter, wanted to give it a try.  While it will never replace the real thing, it had a really good roasted peanut flavor and a smooth, creamy texture.  I ate it smeared over two Corn Thin cakes, with 1/2 tbsp of reduced sugar jam and it was really satisfying, all for 104 calories! I probably won't eat this by the spoonful, like I love to do with peanut butter, but it will be great in sandwiches or with apples as a healthy snack.  I am very satisfied with the taste and texture of this peanut butter.  Yay!"
253214,B004TSRJ1W,2.0,A rather strange tasting pea soup. Not at all like any other I've tried.  Not that it wouldn't be bad but it's just too off for me to recommend.
17916,B001EO653M,5.0,"I found this product in a coffee shop in Chincoteague, VA  And was blown away by it's taste.  Energizing, but not too over the top.  And I received it quickly."
254787,B007PA32L2,2.0,I was really excited to see this flavor of coffee in K cups because my hubby loves anything pumpkin and thought this would be a great surprise to him. Unfortunately it has a really odd after taste. He thinks its the type of coffee used with the pumpkin flavoring but I'm not too sure. Either way we'll never buy this product again.

253752,B003C1RIEK,2.0,"Palatable for kids but that's about the best I can say about them.  On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates, but at the cost per cup for these should be much better.  Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2% milk is required even to get a child to drink them.  My advice is to pick up an alternative brand's seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K-cup makers and skip this Green Mountain/Cafe Escapes variety- as these are disappointing at best.<br /><br />Avoid if possible, but not a total waste.  Consider my 2 stars as ""generous."""

This is the only flavor of this ""soda"" I've tried as well.<br /><br />Because of the price I'm not sure if I'd buy this or just continue using my juicer.<br /><br />Another issue is that it is very high in calories.<br /><br />I believe this is a high quality drink and would recommend it highly."

154802,B0014WYXTC,3.0,"These little cans of Izze sparkling grapefruit juices went into a big ice chest for a recent party, and I was stunned to see how popular they were among the tween-aged kids. Parents had no objections to the caffeine- and processed-sugar-free drinks, and they taste refreshing and crisp.<br /><br />That said, nothing beats water if you really want to have the perfect health drink. And I was frustrated to have chosen grapefruit flavor, which I had forgotten was off-limits to a family member because of medication restrictions. For those who want soda or energy drink, this won't be a replacement, in spite of those who would call it a healthy soda.<br /><br />Overall, however, these sparkling juices are a great summer choice. Refreshing, relatively healthy and super popular from kids to adults -- we'll be adding them to our future shopping lists for sure."

He spit it back out!!  Not sure if it was the smell, or the taste, but I hate to report that it would be a waste of money for me to buy these.

Unfortunately despite my best efforts to seal and store this tea properly it lost its spearmint potency very very quickly and it eventually became completely undrinkable. I've bought other Davidsons bulk bags before though and enjoyed them all for a very long time, so I think the problem with this tea is not so much a quality issue (as I said, the first couple brewings were great) but rather it has to do with the shelf life of the spearmint."

I have the standard powdered hot chocolate in the cupboard but my kids seem to go for the Abuelita first.  They add one broken tablet and milk into the Cocomotion and in a few minutes they are in hot chocolate heaven.  Abuelita has a homemade dark chocolate taste that is not found in most conventional powdered brands.  This a product that is well worth keeping on hand for those hot chocolate days."

It's difficult to find regular soft drinks that don't contain corn syrup.  I decided to give The Switch a try because it contains ordinary sugar.<br /><br />I liked the taste of the Black Cherry Switch.  It tasted more like fruit punch than black cherry though.  This makes sense because cherries are at the bottom of the fruit ingredients list.  Apple juice comprises most of the fruit juice in Black Cherry Switch.  Marketing this as ""black cherry"" is a bit misleading.  They should call it carbonated ""fruit drink"" instead of ""black cherry.""  It annoys me when marketers employ deceptive advertising.<br /><br />That being said, I did enjoy the taste.  I just recommend that people read the ingredients list before buying."

77636,B001LG940E,4.0,"First and foremost, I am not a big fan of soft drinks.  Too much sugar and way too unhealthy for any person.  This goes for diet as well - trading sugar for chemicals is absurd.<br /><br />Fruit juices are ok, but they are so over processed that any of the healthy aspects of the juice are boiled or filtered out and all you are left with is a sweet fluid that has naturals sugars instead of added sucrose - better but not by much.<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry is a great offering that replaces added sucrose and fructose for real fruit juices.  It is very refreshing and every bit as tasty as some artificially colored and sweetened brand name soda.  I was impressed.<br /><br />The only downside from my perspective is that they use highly filtered juices.  They do this so that the end product has the same look and feel to the mass marketed name brands, but I would prefer unfiltered juice and I would not be bothered by a slightly more colloid appearance.  But this is nit picking on my part.<br /><br />This is a great product with a great taste.  If you like sodas, you will like this a lot."

Four days later and he was still terribly constipated, and he struggled. We decided to change to Baby's One and within a a day he was having some normal looking bowel movements. I was really disappointed that this formula was so harsh for his stomach. I think the intentions were good but it obviously isn't a complete trade off and I have read that they extra fortify the milk-base formula with more lactose which makes it difficult for children to digest. My son is taking really well with Baby's only and we will continue with this formula since its better than non-organic."

17578,B0000GH6UQ,5.0,"I have never used this to make a hot chocolate drink, but it is my favorite chocolate to use in cookies.  Chopped into chunks and mixed in the dough, it stands in for normal chocolate chips beautifully.  The slightly grainy texture comes through the baking perfectly intact and creates a wonderful contrast with the chewy cookie.  Try it!  It's wonderful."
132614,B004EWT89O,1.0,PURCHASED AT AMAZON VERY BAD PRODUCT! TASTE LIKE VINAGAR WATER.DURKEE BUTTER FLAVORING.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.VERY SORRY I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.CAN'T BELEIVE DURKEE PUT THEIR NAME ON THIS PRODUCT.
155562,B000FFLHU2,3.0,"I got my MACA powder about 2 wks ago and I was excited since I had heard so many good things about it. However, I have to say the taste and smell has made me very nauseous. I just tried mixing it with soy milk and it was just too much for me. I only mixed about a tsp into 10oz of soymilk. I could taste it and smell it at every gulp. I don't know if these reviewers got a different batch than I have but it definitely smells HORRIBLE. Like I want to throw up every time it passes under my nose. Since I am a college student, I just can't waste the entire thing like that. So I decided to make my own capsules. I feel like I can definitely make more than 300 veggie capsules with this bag. I have no problem drinking 6 capsules to drinking this raw MACA. Plus making my own capsules will probably end up cheaper than buying the capsules from another company. Then at least you know exactly what is going in it and you can buy another powder and mix that into the capsule too. And I would buy it again for that reason.<br /><br />Definitely an acquired taste."
157063,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"I really, really wanted to enjoy this coffee; hazelnut Cr&egrave;me brl&eacute;e Delish! I absolutely love coffee and this has several things in its favor:<br /><br />*aroma<br />*quality packaging: This comes in a plastic bag with reclosing strap, but you'll still want to store the bag in an airtight container.<br />*ground fine: This is for richer flavor. The best brands do this.<br />*image: If you delight in coffee and want to think of other parts of the world as you sip it, this company really shoots for that image.<br />*Reasonable price.<br /><br />The aroma is probably the best part. It's a tradition for my husband and me to open fresh coffee together, and while he's never been a fan of flavored coffee, he says this one's ""Not bad."" He likes a coffee that gets his attention. Bitter coffee earns his respect. But the bottom line is, this coffee is very bitter and leaves an aftertaste. Now, is that bitterness from the bean itself, or from the flavoring? I'd need to try the regular and get a comparison to answer that for you.<br /><br />That said, the bitterness came as a bit of a surprise to me because the beans are grown at a higher elevation and the package states that the beans are never bitter. The higher elevation reduces the acidity in coffee and therefore the bitterness. So when you brew a cup and it turns out it is bitter...the image doesn't take that away or allow people to ignore it; rather, it lifts expectations only to disappoint.<br /><br />But elevation isn't the only issue. It also matters what kind of beans these are. Are these Arabica beans? Those are the good stuff-the ones you really want to buy because of their lack of bitterness. Grow them high-sure-but the bean still matters. So, whether or not these are Arabica, I don't know: I couldn't find the ingredients list on the package and it doesn't say elsewhere.<br /><br />So, all told, I really wanted to enjoy the creative cr&egrave;me brul&eacute;e flavor since I love hazelnut cr&egrave;me brul&eacute;e and coffee, too-but the bitterness gets in the way. Reasonable price, though."

Its all quality stuff,<br />except for this jazz. I repeat, just grab a bottle of Crystal if you want a good flavorful New<br />Orleans style sauce, and its cheap. 2 Pods"
17838,B0001FQVCA,5.0,...not something you want to eat every day unless you have a robust metabolism (low-cal this stuff is NOT!) but if you allow yourself an occasional splurge this is just AWESOME.  I can't believe I never tried it until now.
125126,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"I've read all the reviews of this product and I feel I must add my name to the chorus of negative reviews on the new recipe.  I can't express how disappointed I was with the new recipe.  I started eating dark chocolate about 12 years ago.  I started with sharffen berger which is quite good chocolate.  I tried various brands.  I wanted the healthy dark but wasn't interested in eating 85% because I wanted to balance flavor with health.  That is where the old recipe of this 70% bar was perfect at.  It tasted better than the Sharffen berger to me and every other bar I had tried.  Now they take this wonderful bar and ruin it for poorly thought out reasons.  I still had a bar of the old when the new came out and I did a blind taste test in my family of four.  All thought the old was better than the new.  So Lindt's marketing machine is doing itself a great disservice by continuing to perpetuate the lie that most people actually like the new recipe.  Note that in my grocery store I can still find the 1.2 oz bars as of August 2011 that are labeled Intense dark.  These bars are still made in france and have no soy products in them (although they say it may contain ""traces"" of soy beans but all chocolate products say that due to the factory environment in which they are made).<br /><br />For me at least money is no object for this purchase and I'm not rich.  Just trying to prioritize good food over other things in my life.  I would gladly pay the higher price if the exchange rate was the issue or if the ingredients were the issue.  The bottom line is the new recipe is horrible.  Don't purchase if you like chocolate.  If you like wax just buy a candle and eat that."
17143,B001NJJOCW,5.0,"I'm pretty sure a lot of us have tried the ""Chef's"" spaghetti, ravioli, etc.  These little microwaveable bowls make it so easy to have lunch, a snack, or dinner.  It's not only great for kids but it's good for adults, too.<br /><br />It's nice to have a variety on hand when someone gets the ""munchies"" and doesn't have a lot of time to cook.  It's not gourmet by any means but definitely satisfies the appetite for a little Italian food......quick and easy."
251049,B002INDU22,2.0,"I've tried another brand of miracle fruit tablets during a party. All the guests put them in their mouths and the tablets nearly instantly dissolved. After 10 seconds or so, they were eating up lime wedges like no tomorrow.<br /><br />This one, in comparison, is like a standard hard tablet. Everyone sat around for several minutes waiting for them to dissolve. The end effect was not nearly as impressive, as the sour items still had quite a bit of tart to them.<br /><br />I will not be buying this brand anymore."
164622,B007RTR8TS,3.0,"I've been coloring my hair for over 10 years, along with using a blow dryer on an almost daily basis. Because of the on going damage done to my hair I have found several inexpensive products that work well for me so that I'm not breaking the bank just to fix my hair. The pricing on this product is slightly higher than what I normally pay and because of that I expected it to be a better performing conditioner.<br /><br />I used the conditioner for a full 7 days expecting to see at least some results at that point. Unfortunately I did not see my hair get any better, it actually stayed the same. I know that quite often they suggest using the same brand shampoo, in addition to the conditioner, but I have found that this isn't always necessary to get good results.  No matter how little or how much conditioner I used, I didn't see any improvement. Eventually I had no choice but to go back to my old brand because my hair just couldn't take it any longer.<br /><br />I gave this product 3 stars because I didn't see any improvement, but since I did not use it in conjunction with the same brand of shampoo I didn't rate it any less. Whether that would actually make a difference I don't know?"
244102,B00029F5E0,2.0,"I have used this products for 6-7 years and always loved it, until today....I ordered this from Amazon and received it a few days ago. First I noticed a new label on the tub. OK, but then as I scooped out my first scoop I noticed a color change..instead of being the color of something like Nestle Quik powder my protein was a very light shade of tan...bad sign. Still, I gave it a chance..after mixing and tasting I felt duped! Different texture and WEAK flavor - where did my rich Cocoa flavor go? I could have picked this product out of a blind test after having it every day for that many years.... the new version is awful....did I just get a bad batch? HELP."
245678,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"Because of the picture and description, I expected 34 different coffees, perhaps with a few duplicates. What I didn't expect to get was 6 Green Mountain French Vanilla, 6 Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette, 6 Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream, and 4 Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry. I also received 2 each of 5 other flavored, and 1 each of 2 other flavors.  This is not my opinion of 34 different flavors."

16964,B0026RNRJ6,5.0,Cannot get Cinnamon Dentyne where I live and it is the only gum I chew.  I usually stock up when I go to visit family in Canada so was thrilled to see I could get it at Amazon.
17355,B000EVIDUY,5.0,Delicious fudgy brownies.  We tried the oil-instead-of butter option.  It was very good.  I added a tablespoon of leftover coffee to the batter and toasted walnuts.  My non-celiac husband requests more brownies!  I love a mix the whole family likes and we all can eat!
133427,B0090X8IPM,1.0,"I got a free sample of this product (ground coffee beans) from the Starbucks company today (December 29, 2010).  The artificial vanilla flavor was NOT impressive.  It simply does not taste much like vanilla.  The added ""vanilla"" just provides some off-beat chemical flavor.  Even worse, is that this chemical flavor lingers on the metal coffee filter, and contaminates the flavor of any coffee that is subsequently brewed.<br /><br />Another overall problem with Starbucks coffee is that, in an attempt to imitate Peet's coffee, the Starbucks company provides a generous roasting of their coffee, but they over-roast their coffee to the point that the overwhelming flavor is one of charred or burned wood.<br /><br />Thus, for my 5-cup a day habit, I stick to Folger's, and when I want to treat myself, I buy Peets.  I am not sure why the Starbucks company is so successful, but I am sure it has MORE TO DO with their nice furniture, the creative nomenclature of their coffees, various other marketing gimmicks, and the endless selection of sugared, candied, confectioned, and embellished coffees, and LESS TO DO with the quality of the coffee itself.<br /><br />As a graduate student at U.C. Berkeley, I lived directly across the street from the first Peet's coffee shop, located at Walnut Square in Berkeley, California.  I first went to Peet's in the year 1973."
127091,B001EO5PDI,1.0,"Bought this ""granola"" because it looked good on the box with the dried cherries in it.  It turns out it is ""granola"" in only the loosest sense because it has just a bit of real granola (ie; rolled oats) mixed in with a whole bunch of rice crisps.  Cheap.<br /><br />The worst part though was the complete lack of cherries.  The photo on the box shows dried cherries interspersed in the spoonful of cereal depicted.  But when I poured out my first bowl of cereal no cherries whatsoever were visible.  I wondered if maybe they had all settled to the bottom, so I took the bag out of the box to look... no cherries at the bottom either.  I poured the entire contents into a mixing bowl and eventually found a single chunk, about 1/8 the size of a pea, that might have been a tiny chip off of a cherry at one point.  That was it.  Putting ""cherries"" in the name of this cereal is thus a total lie.  It should read ""there might be a remote chance that you'll find a tiny chunk off of just one cherry in this cereal"".  What a ripoff."
17432,B0045Z6K50,5.0,This is my very favorite blend of coffee in the Keurig k-cups form.  It is rich and dark and is still that way when you make a large mug of coffee...some of the k-cups are weaker as you make a bigger cup.  I love that it's Fair Trade and an Organic Blend makes it all the better.  I wish that I could find it in a decaf version that was larger than a 12-pack.
77018,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Some products these days have you wondering where's the chocolate, but not this one. I can say that it has plenty of chocolate chunks mixed in with the granola. I used it as cereal. I did like the taste, but it got pretty soft in the milk, except for those plentiful chocolate chunks. When mixed with milk you need something with the granola they used to perk it up and that's where the chocolate comes in."
130163,B0017U9VIO,1.0,"The nutritional information on this website states that the ""Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip"" bar has 16 grams of protein, but the Macrobar website states that it only has 15 grams of protein.  It's also weird that their ""protein"" bars have less protein than this bar."
235998,B000COEZXC,2.0,"Though these pill pockets are very effective (and tasty) for dispensing medication to my cat, the Amazon web page clearly shows the ingredients to include probiotics.

130941,B001EQ4NYS,1.0,I was very disappointed in this item. Upon opening the Bag I could smell that the nuts were stale.It appears to be the peanuts. The expiration date was June 2010. I believe the packaging needs to be changed. It also says no salt. However there are 50 mg of salt in a serving.
77058,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"very tasty, but watch the calories!!! A 1/2 cup has over 200 calories! And the fat content is high, also. I tend to eat more than a half cup of cereal at a time. Having said that, the flavor and texture are very nice. Yummy chocolate pieces. Not too soft, and not too crunchy. So, if you don't mind the calorie/fat content, it's a very good cereal. Probably better as a small snack or treat."
160285,B007PHPTAC,3.0,"I bought these to use in my guest rooms at my b&b. I offer locally roasted beans at breakfast but wanted to have something in the rooms for those ""all day"" coffee drinkers.<br /><br />I had been using a standard coffee from one of the large hotel suppliers and wanted to upgrade. Well, this coffee tastes almost exactly like the one I wanted to replace. It is also more expensive than the brand I was using. It tastes like Folgers, lots of chemicals in the processing or something.<br /><br />I won't be buying any more of this and have subsequently discovered another brand which makes amazing packet coffee."

16865,B001LGGH40,5.0,"This carbonated blend of juices is a refreshing drink.  The kiwi and strawberry flavors come through more distinctly, and when drinking while eating, it is the strawberry flavor that dominates.  Because Switch is not as carbonated as soda, it does not need to have added sugar, a definite plus.  The lower carbonation also makes it easier to drink.  I am now intrigued to try the other flavors that Switch makes."

But of the 3-4 times that I tried it, I couldn't even finish a bottle.  Seriously, this makes Reed's seem good by comparison and that stuff is pretty bad too.

The liquid forms worked great, but I needed something to sweeten a gallon of iced tea at a time, and counting out that many drops sounded miserable.<br /><br />This stuff works great! I use 1/8 tsp. plus 1/64 tsp. (the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MOYI5W"">Amco Measuring Spoons for Small Amounts</a> are great for this purpose) to sweeten a gallon of tea, and it's as sweet as a heaping cup of granular splenda (or sugar).

Truthfully,  this is the closest you can get to giving your dog jerky.  My vet is a holistic vet and I consequently don't give my dog just any treat.  Still, my tiny toy poodle is VERY particular, even to the point of knowing which flavor he wants when I hold up the bags!  I bought the lamb liver, chicken and venison and venison but he loves all of the flavors, even the fish.  I like the fact that they are all natural and I'd recommend them in a heartbeat."
243230,B007CABOD8,2.0,"This item was a bit of a disappointment. I expected better flavor. It has a sour start but that is it. The cherry and soda flavor is very faint and difficult to taste. The texture is what you would expect from a quality gummy, soft and slightly firm but chewy. The sour is spot on, it will make you pucker. e.frutti normally has wonderful products with abundant flavor, sadly this product was not one of them. I ordered 4 bags (8.8 pounds), opened one and ate a few and gave the three remaining bags away to less discriminate gummy consumers. I rated this product low because I expected better flavor and not just sour gummy. If you enjoy sour and are less concerned with flavor, this product may be right for you."

The cookies are fairly soft but more importantly, I would never know it was a ginger cookie if I didn't read the product description. It tastes more like a mellow chocolate chip cookie. They should have made these with more ginger."
236691,B008YA1NWC,2.0,"My problem with this coffee is that it is too light. I can't brew it on the 10oz setting because by the time its about half done it looks like water dripping down. I tried it today on 8oz which was a little better but still very light. No I am not a strong coffee person. I prefer medium blends so I was surprised at how light this was. Otherwise I do like the coconut flavor, its not overpowering and its not too light but I won't buy again."

However, there are an overwhelming amount of sunflower seeds, so much that they overwhelm all the other great ingredients.

151113,B001Q9EFW8,3.0,"I have 2 dogs, a sheltie mix and long haired chiauaua, I will say that the ""LARGE"" size biscuits were way to big for both of my dogs so I broke the large biscuit in half and gave each dog a piece of it. The dogs loved them! In fact I went to my front door to get the box and normally my dogs don't get excited about boxes. But this time I guess they could smell the treats inside because they both went crazy! I'll say that the box is bigger then I expected, contains approx 16 biscuits. The ""serving size"" on the box I'm not sure about as it says ""for best results give 2 twice a day. If my math is right they want you to feed your dog a total of 4 of these a day and at that rate the box will last 3 and a half days.  If the treats were healthier and not so much filler I wouldn't see a problem with this IF it really helps the teeth, but with it being mostly filler I couldn't see feeding my dogs 4 of these every day. They are a good treat every now and then, but certainly not to be used as an on-going dental treatment because you would go through 2 boxes a week and at the current price it would be about $48 a month and that is just for 1 dog. These in my opinion are purely TREATS and not dental supplements. I will be submitting a picture of my dogs with these treats if you would like to see how excited they were when I got them out! I rated these at 3 out of 5 simply because of the healthiness of these compared to the ""recommended serving."" As far as my dogs go, I think they would give it a 5."

The light syrup gives it a nice flavor. What I like most about these is the texture of the fruit retains a lot of the crunchiness of a fresh pear, while most canned pears are soft throughout. So to me, this product is something like a hybrid of fresh pears and canned pears. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and will order again. 4 stars for the relatively expensive price, but otherwise a 5 star product."
77224,B002YZXRT0,4.0,"Despite the product being damaged during the shipment, the bottles that were intact were very satisfying.

16876,B001LGGH40,5.0,"This stuff is surprisingly good. A lightly carbonated fruit drink, it's got a tangy-sweet flavor that's really unique. The cans themselves are awfully small, but the taste is truly big. It's made from 100% juice with no added sugar, corn syrup, or artifical sweeteners, yet plenty sweet enough naturally for most people's taste I'd think. My 12-year-old son loves it too. A terrific, natural drink. Ingredients include apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry juice concentrates reconstitued with filtered, sparkling water. It's all natural though they have added vitamin C so that it provides 100% RDA. A most excellent drink I'll continue buying for a very long time."

It also lacks those nasty preservatives.<br /><br />The problem with buying this product from Amazon is the way Amazon delivers it. My 24 pack was delivered in a regular cardboard box. The Izze packaging is just a flimsy cardboard tray with plastic wrap covering the cans. The wrap doesn't cover the cans very well and isn't particularly snug. Since Amazon does pack this into a regular cardboard box for you, you won't need to worry about losing any of the cans in transit - but they will be clanking around in the box when it arrives on your doorstep. Open them slowly. If the Amazon box was smaller, this wouldn't happen."

I cooked it very simply - just added a good olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried marjoram after it was boiled (slightly undercooked) - very good. I could see where you might not stay full for long with the reduced carbs, but if you want to be able to eat pasta this is a good one to try."
240099,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"I know, I know, I should be grateful for anything I receive through Vine because I got it for FREE! I guess I do feel grateful to find out what doesn't work for me and my dog. My smiling UPS man delivered this PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound right to my front door,gave my dog a scratch behind the ears, and set it right inside the door for me. The box was slightly squished but still taped shut. I cut the box open being careful not to cut the Beneful bag only to find that Amazon had packed it very nicely with lots of brown packing paper so my Amazon packaging and delivery experience was pretty excellent but that doesn't go in a product review so I will get back to the review! Upon opening the cardboard box flap, a waft of rancid oil smell hit me right in the nose and knocked me backwards so much it nearly knocked me over. I knew I had to deal with it quick before the rancid odor spread throughout our clean fresh smelling home! Is the smell coming from the box (sniff=no odor), the packing paper (sniff=slight odor=woozy), or the Beneful bag? (sniff=gag gag gag). OMG If it is not fit for a human to smell, it is not fit for a dog to eat! This dogfood is called Beneful with lots of healthy foods pictured next to a dog making you think this dog food is full of benefits for your beloved furry friend. However, what it should have is a dog rolled over on his side, sick, with a clothespin on his nose! I did not feel grateful for feeling nauseated and woozy, but hey, you know what? After writing my review, I do feel grateful! Go figure.<br /><br />I don't think Beneful is full of benefits for us but maybe to Monsanto because the ingredients are probably all GMO.<br /><br />Thank you Vine!"
151107,B001Q9EFW8,3.0,"I guess when they did the taste test for these and stated preferred two to one sadly my dog (Chloe) was sitting in the other group. I have a 12 lbs. Papillon and give her the competitor bones and she loves those. I don't think it was the flavor as much as the size with these. For being `small' the bones are twice as large as the other ones. I think that was the issue for my `Chloe', she could not get her poor small mouth around it. She would try to suck it until it was ready to break. Even if I broke it, the pieces were too thick. I think if they were not so thick she would not have any issues. As far as the breath factor I did notice it improved in that area! That alone I would buy them but the size is what would deter me. I gave some to a bigger dog, a 55 lbs lab mix and he did not have a problem chewing them but still had to break the bone up. Over all I think it is a good idea but the size is not what I would consider small. Maybe a small treat for a bigger dog but too big for small dogs."

They've been so picky with dog food that it was a relief to find something they would willingly eat. However, my Corgi liked to just pick out the soft pieces and leave the hard food for my Chihuahua. Because she only ate the soft pieces and gorged until the bowl was empty, my Corgi became overweight and her dental health suffered. We had to switch to a different brand to keep her healthy.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who feels the packaging is false advertising. There is no meat or vegetables in Beneful. It says right on here that the first two ingredients are ground cornmeal and chicken by-product. Yuck! That really grossed me out. I don't want my dogs eating this anymore and switched them to a more wholesome brand."

He loves chocolate brownies so after reading most of the positive reviews here, I decided to buy the six-pack brownie mix and try it out.<br /><br />My husband liked the taste though he admitted it was nowhere near as rich and flavorful as the Ghirardelli Brownie mixes which I use occasionally at home. Taste aside, he also experienced bloating and excessive gas. Initially I thought this was due to something else he ate, but when he ate another brownie, similar effects convinced us it was due to the maltitol ingredient in the mix.<br /><br />I think this mix will be OK for those who are not averse to Maltitol, but I would not advise it for those who are averse to it.

252518,B003OB4BFW,2.0,"I bought this partially based on another reviewer's statement that this had a strong taste of lime. Maybe I got a bad batch?<br /><br />The one I tried, before I gave it all to my roommate, was unbelieveably bland. I could taste no lime flavor in it at all and definitely no shrimp. I haven't tried any other flavors of Maruchan Ramen in years, though, so this could be typical of this brand, I don't know. I can tell the difference with Top Ramen.<br /><br />Now, I really like Maruchan noodle cups. I prefer their shrimp and lime shrimp flavors above all the others, which is the main reason why I decided to try this flavor of ramen.<br /><br />I am a really good cook, but on a very, very limited fixed income and I try to help out one of my roommates, who has a son and gets even less money than I, so part of my diet has to come from ramen and noodle cups.<br /><br />This flavor is bland, at least to my palate, it was. I greatly prefer the taste of chicken and beef flavor Top Ramen.<br /><br />Not much else to say about it. The price wasn't bad, about the same as Walmart and my roommate isn't picky, he says all ramens taste the same to him and he was glad to get any kind of food, since it's getting near to the end of the month.<br /><br />I definitely won't buy this flavor again, though."

General Mills did an excellent job getting the flavors right. The orange flavor in the shape of Velma and the blueberry flavored Scooby are the most realistic flavors, though all are quite good.

Unfortunately the chili turned out to be (no disrespect intended to Skyline fans in Cincinnati and elsewhere) inedible--at least to my taste buds--and looking nothing like the product depicted on the can wrapper. The contents consisted of half watery soup, half highly spiced meat, and resembling nothing like the savory, meaty chili described by the website writer. Even after pouring off all the liquid, the remaining chili was so heavily spiced with I believe to be a heavy dose of cloves and perhaps some cinnamon and other ingredients that I stopped eating after a single bite.<br /><br />Still, wanting to believe that I could somehow employ this chili to help mimic the taste of my beloved Coney Islander cheese dogs, I asked my wife to sample the chili, who proclaimed it to be ""awful.""<br /><br />Much as I hate to step on a product that some people no doubt love, I have to say this is the absolute worst canned chili I've ever eaten. It was so bad I felt slightly nauseated a few minutes after having the single bite, and a faint worry about food poisoning briefly entered my mind.<br /><br />Needless to say, the five other cans were summarily tossed into the garbage.

I don't know what it is they used to replace the fat with but it just didn't work with this particular soup (I've tried the healthy request mushroom soup and cream of chicken and they weren't bad).<br /><br />Sometimes you just need the full-fat for certain things.

135196,B0049OPXP0,1.0,"""My family have been gluten free for 10 years now. I also work in the natural products industry at the senior level and have seen the deception first hand. Gluten is quite a serious issue as when it is consumed the villi are inpaired and other nutrients needed to be assimilated for other necessary body functions are not absorbed. It has caused my family other serious complications from eyesight to teeth and mouth difficulties and it has to stop. I am writing this reveiw because I am tired of feeling powerless while companies are prospering at the expense of our health. I follow a paleolithic diet for the most part and recently for my birthday decided to have a turkey sandwich on Udi's bagels. Well they are most certainly not gluten free. EVEN IF LESS THAN 5ppm still makes someone sick. My entire mouth broke out in canker sores and I got a white spot on my front tooth that has not gone away because the gluten sensitivity is preventing iron absorption. Udi's is making millions of dollars and people are getting sick even if they are not sensitive enough to feel it. We had the gluten tested at the doctor's and yep sure enough it was UDI's bread that we reacted to. I hope this review helps at least one other person not get sick."""

236149,B0051SUBKK,2.0,"This is another example of a mediocre at best ginger ale dressed up with fancy packaging at a ridiculous price while not even coming close the complexity or intensity of many of the better Ginger Beers. Unfortunately, Amazon places you in a paradox in buying some of the better ones. The top two aren't carried by Amazon at all but Amazon does carry some decent ones. Aside from the two that are 5 star and will go unnamed as they are already too difficult to get AND sticking w/ those that have free shipping since w/o free shipping, you are likely to pay well more for the s/h than the actual product.<br /><br />Loathe that I am to admit it, Bruce Cost's is pretty good-not nearly as good as it should be given the alternatives and he screws some them up with flavoring, which; to my mind is like taking Peet's French Roast and trying to get a hazelnut/vanilla flavor to it. But he fancies himself the guru of all things Asian (as far as I know, he is the only one who shares that opinion)and the rhizome ginger is Asian so he makes a 12 pack and charges $50 for it. All of the British ginger ale is no better than Canada Dry (who used absolutely no ginger in its ginger ale until the past couple of years)so skip the Fever Tree. Bermuda Ginger Beer is frequently very good and Amazon has had a few. I believe Regatta is from Bermuda but as a form of torture with which Tantalus would be familiar, Amazon generally offers the Diet with free shipping and the stuff that tastes good with exorbitant shipping. Blenheim is a marketing campaign, they know that many of the better ginger beers are spicy so they make a spectrum of spicy GBs, but they are one dimensional, heat only. Two of the better known brands, Reed's and Boylan's don't appeal to me. When they were the only premium GBs on the market, I drank them but i don't think either makes the top ten anymore. Two good ones in bottles that Amazon carries w/o s/h are Saranac & Eli's, neither are cheap but it's delivered to your door and includes what we in CA have to pay as CRV and s/h are generally free. Now for the best deals Amazon offers. Bottles are expensive to ship so that cost will, to some extent at least, be built in somewhere. In some cases it's worth it. The two best bottled GBs that Amazon carries that are usually free s/h are 1) A J Stephen's (sp?) and 2) Cock & Bull which, urban legend has it as being brewed specifically for the Brown Derby restaurant,an LA icon and is called for by name in a cocktail named the Moscow Mule. Can's are significantly cheaper to ship and I have 3 recommendations for them. I keep a variety of strengths of ginger juice, grated fresh ginger, & ginger syrup so I can sometimes salvage a GB that is a little too bland. That is the case with Santa Cruz organic GB, it's almost good (by which I mean far better than Schwepps or Canada Dry but not top tier. If you have some ginger extracts around you can get it pretty good. Occasionally, Amazon will have the Ginger People's product with free shipping. That's definitely worth a look as it has pieces of ginger still floating in it. The single best deal on Amazon, in my estimation, is Barr's. It's canned so you can get a reasonably priced 24 pack, usually with free S/H. The problem is that Amazon is more often sold out than not. I probably wouldn't have mentioned it if I didn't already have 3 cases en route to my house. I haven't seen it often enough to get around to studying it's heritage but it's the best tasting canned ginger beer I've ever had-and at a great price. I think the single best deal for consuming on a daily basis is Vernors. I occasionally can find it on sale at $2.99 a six pack. I don't think I've ever seen a great deal on Amazon but if they offered free shipping on Vernors, I'd probably get a couple cases a month. It's a little sweet and not really gingery/pungent as the best but can be a great deal.<br /><br />I confess to knowing not very much about Jamaican GB. I've tried Idris and it's pretty good. Most of the Jamaican stuff on Amazon seems to be in 64 oz. 1/2 gallons, plastic and I'm not too fond of that. Well that my not very humble opinion.I'm going to have a 12 oz. bottle of my favorite. I'm not going to share the name online but if I get an email (besides hate mail) I'll tell you. Of course I may be the only one in this country this fanatical about a soft drink so I won't expect an overflowing in box. Do yourself a favor, though, skip Canada Dry - unless you need a mixer or have a sick kid."

132548,B00141SPNI,1.0,"I have used these products for several years for my Cairn Terrier. Have always purchased them in health food stores and felt it was a safe product. Never had a problem. However, I recently(June) purchased this item from Amazon and recieved the 6 bags. It took a couple of severe illnesses in my dog for me to connect the mellow mut strips. He initially started vomiting yellow bile and it proceeded to a vomiting/diarrhea progression that lasted for two weeks with much abdominal pain. The first time, I thought he had just injested something outside that had caused inflammation in his abdominal tract. My dog eats an excellent, mostly organic diet...is seven years old and in great health and vitality. After the first bout of this ""mystery illness"" I didnt give him any treats for a while(because of the dehydrated form) just a very bland diet of rice and chicken/beef working back in to adding veggies etc that would be in his normal diet...he was fine. A few days ago, with the presence of wonderful health in my dog, I opened a bag of the mellow mut strips and gave him one per day for three days. Here we are again, same illness...same symptoms. This time, I made the connection...did some internet research and found numerous pet owners who have experienced the same ""toxic"" problems with these Dogswell products.

The rings weren't all ring shaped. The taste was blah. I looked on the box to see where they were made and got really concerned. THey said ""Made For Manhattan Chocolate and Nuts, Inc. Bayonne, NJ 07002"". Considering how many foods get recalled, shouldn't it say where they are ACTUALLY made? Got at Costco and I'm taking them back. Worth trying once so you can really appreciate Joyva, lol. My son loves Jelly Rings and wouldn't take more than one bite. Lesson learned. Two thumbs down."
240189,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"We have fed our dog Purina Dog Chow and many of the Purina dog treats for years and have come to trust the Purina label. When we decided to try feeding Beneful to our dog, we started gradually, adding a little bit to his regular feeding and then increasing it gradually. We only increased to 1/4 of our dog's regular feeding when he started having problems with upset stomach and eating grass all the time and seemed to lose his appetite. We stopped feeding the Beneful and within a couple of days he was back to his old self. We decided to try again, and had the same results. I don't have a clue what makes this food intolerable to our pet, but I am truly surprised that a Purina product is causing this problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with these results, I cannot recommend Beneful as the healthy and nutritious food that is portrayed on the packaging."
161676,B0077D0UL2,3.0,I know this is a finer powder than coffee but I was not expecting it to sift out of kcups into the box. Think the boxes should be shrink wrapped like some of the coffee we receive so that it was not such a mess. Flavor was just too sweet. Will not buy again.
163058,B0014DY0O4,3.0,I remember in my childhood loving peanut butter candy of any sort to death well after ordering this I began thinking to myself why. Maybe my taste has changed and I'm not interested in quantity anymore but this just isn't as good as I remember it being. It has that mass produced taste and it was all to easy to down 3-4 of them at a time. Its candy and I know thats a problem with me but i'm beginning to see the appreciation for quality food and this is not quality chocolate.
82498,B003IDF86C,4.0,Found this at costco while visiting my brother in Phoenix Az. As one of the other reviewers said this works for me being a Type 2 Diabetic it is easy on the blood sugar and zero sodium is a winner in my book and tastes good also. But the price hear is wacked as $7 bucks at costco is a great deal. I have not been able to find it in my local costco here in the Seattle area but will request it !

17392,B004EI0ZMC,5.0,"With peanut butter prices going through the roof, I've been looking for a more economical way way of buying it in bulk.  We have four kids, and I eat a low carb diet, so we eat a lot of peanut butter.  When I saw this 35-pound bucket offered with free SuperSaver shipping, I leaped!<br /><br />The product itself is very good - just like Fisher's other nuts and products, it has a great flavor, and it's creamy and not too salty.  The lid on the bucket fits well, so I can reseal it after transferring some of it to smaller jars for the kitchen.  It's a little messy having to dip it out that way, but well worth it when I save $1-2 per pound over buying store brand peanut butter at the grocery.  I spray a one cup measuring cup with cooking spray, to keep it from sticking too much, and use a rubber scraper to get it all in the jar without any waste.<br /><br />I notice the price has risen from $60 to $90 since I bought my bucket.  I probably wouldn't have purchased this bucket at $90, but I'll be watching the price and will buy it again when it's a great bargain like when I purchased it."
125128,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"I remember the first time I tried a Lindt 70% bar, when I visited France as a child.  My parents bought several to bring back to the States, and they were cherished and eaten slowly.  I've enjoyed them as a special treat ever since.<br /><br />Sadly, that era has ended.  The ""new recipe"" is a shadow of the former Lindt chocolate.  It tastes like pretty much any other standard dark chocolate bar -- none of the crisp, vibrant, complexity it used to have.<br /><br />I guess all good things eventually come to an end...too bad."
247630,B001EO5WTU,2.0,"After having the hazelnut flavored coffee of this same brand, I was disappointed in the French Vanilla flavor. The hazelnut was much better.<br /><br />I would not buy the French Vanilla again as I did not find that the flavor warranted more than a 2 star rating."

132468,B0087PHU4Y,1.0,"Go with Simply Heinz Ketchup not these packs its the best ketchup with real sugar. No poisons like HFCS.<br /><br />HFCS.. Here's why it's far more dangerous to your health than table sugar<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is a popular sweetener because it is chemically different from sugar ,it has a longer shelf life and mixes better into beverages. Yet the corn industry likes to downplay these differences, pointing out that sugar is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, while HFCS is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.<br /><br />This framing glosses over an essential difference: sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide composed of a single glucose molecule and a single fructose molecule. HFCS, in contrast, is a liquid solution composed of separated individual glucose and fructose molecules (monosaccharides).<br /><br />To make HFCS, a 100 percent glucose solution is converted via enzymes into a 42 percent fructose-58 percent glucose solution. This solution is further treated until it is 90 percent glucose, then mixed with more 42-58 solution to yield a 55-45 concentration. So while the final ratio of fructose to glucose might look similar to table sugar, it is in fact a very different product. Is it any wonder that HFCS is processed differently by the body?"

But, while they are stronger in hue than the cheap, liquid colors, they are not nearly as intense as the gel colors.  I had to add quite a bit of red and blue to acheive purple, and even then, it wasn't a very vibrant shade.  I would recommend simply due to the taste issue, however."
160119,B001EO5YN4,3.0,"I bought YummyEarth Organic Lollipops to have to have in my office as an alternative to regular candy. First, the mini candy jar containers are handy and cute for display. Then there are the lollipops that look great and the flavors sound delicious. However, I didn't care for any of the flavors accept for the pomegranate (dark red). The pomegranate flavor was very good and exotic. The others were not very good. They tasted bitter. Long story short, no one in the office liked them either...and we have some hard-core sugar junkies that passed on them. If they sold a bag of pomegranate only, I might buy them again."

17696,B000R32F6M,5.0,"Finding high-quality decaffeinated teas in a variety of flavors was something of a chore during my pregnancy so, naturally, I was thrilled to find this winner.<br /><br />I've tried many vanilla teas, both decaffeinated and caffeinated, and it's often hard to find one with a really high-quality vanilla flavor.  This tea succeeds on all counts.  The vanilla is rich and aromatic.  Immediately upon opening the tin, the superior quality of the vanilla becomes apparent in the delicious odor.  Once brewed, this is a very rich cup that benefits from the addition of just a touch of honey or sugar to really enhance the sweetness of the vanilla.  It's delectable.  This is one tea that's worth every penny."

248501,B00377BV9C,2.0,"I splurged and got this for Thanksgiving after dinner coffee.  I was expecting a really excellent flavor but found this coffee to be only ok.  We used Poland Springs bottled water in a drip coffee maker so it wasn't the water.  The coffee was smooth as expected but didn't have the flavor I remembered with another Blue Mountain purchase I made years ago.  I wonder if it's because it was shipped pre-ground and not beans as I kind of expected.  At this price, Newman's Organic blows this completely away and at a fraction of the cost, I will bring that for my next gathering."

148934,B004Q3LBTG,3.0,"I got this baby food maker off of my baby registry. I wanted to make my baby's food so I knew what was going into his mouth. Well, it worked great the first few times and then the plastic broke off the bottom of the container that holds the metal pin in (holding in the blade.) I was able to rig it so that it still worked anyways. Then, a couple days later while making a batch of prunes, the motor went out! Well, surely this was designed to handle something a little thicker like prunes.<br /><br />So, I called and emailed the baby brezza company. About a week later, they did call me and ended up sending me a brand new machine for no charge to me. But, in the meantime I steamed the food in my steamer and used my food processor. I loved that SO much more because I could do large batches. So, I think I may return the brezza. If you want to make food in tiny batches, this would be great. But, I found that a food processor and steamer are much more efficient for large amounts of food to freeze. So, 3 stars (being generous) for the machine and 5 stars for their customer service if it breaks :)"

240272,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"I completely agree that the ingredients for this dog food look revolting, and the pictures on the package don't seem to represent what's actually in the product.  For example, there are clearly pictures of steak on the package, but when I examine the ingredients list, I don't see steak listed.  I also was surprised to see sugar and food colorings in the ingredients list.  Dogs have no nutritional need for sugar, and if they needed sugar to make this yummy for the dog, it must be really low on delicious meat.  Also, I don't see the need for food colorings.  My dog doesn't care what color it is, and if I'm willing to feed him ""by-product meal,"" I'm not sure how it's improved by adding a chemical dye to make it green or whatever.  Also, the chewy bits are not good for their teeth.<br /><br />That said, my dog did act like it was Christmas when I gave him some.  So, two stars.  I won't be switching from my healthier brand to this one, though."
124845,B005EF0HRM,1.0,"At first glance, the Snackalicious Food Gift Basket by Back Mountain Baskets looks like your average snackable goodie basket, complete with various nuts, cookies, pretzels, cheese, dried sausage and candy.<br /><br />It's upon closer inspection that we realized that many of the items have in fact been repackaged with tacky glossy paper featuring inferior color Xeroxes of the original labels, poorly wrapped around repurposed cartons.<br /><br />In other words, the ill-fitting glossy paper with the obviously reproduced MmmmPop! All Natural White Cheddar Popcorn label is barely concealing a reused box of Nabisco Wheat Thins Stix.  Open that up and you'll find a tiny bag of the promised popcorn.<br /><br />Peel back the paper with the color printer copy of Wege of Hanover Sourdough Hards Pretzels and you'll find an old, taped-up box of Cheez-Its, inside of which is a small package of the pretzels.  And lurking behind the paper packaging of the All Natural Fleur De Sel Caramels from France?  Mmmm--a box of irresistible Crystal Light Energy drink Mix.  Inside that are a handful of the advertised caramels.<br /><br />If all this tacky repurposing was part of some green recycling initiative on the part of Back Mountain, then they should have included a note that explained their company philosophy.  But there's no such note--just the feeling that they simply used other boxes so they'd stand up better in the baskets/look more substantial/disguise the fact that some of the items have been divvied up from cost-saving bulk packaging.<br /><br />The end result is something that looks like it was assembled in your own kitchen rather than something you'd order from a presumed legitimate company with the intention of sending to someone as a respectable gift."

160302,B003UHPJGA,3.0,First of all I did not expect the entire bag to be used at one time. I did not see any other directions that may give an idea of how to use in smaller quanities than an entire 2 lb bag. If that were not annoying enough I found the mix to lack taste. Granted you only had to add water but I would buy another mix that may require adding additional ingredients to make it taste better. Disappointing product that I would not try again.

17166,B000EH0RU2,5.0,"I've been eating Nishiki (?) jasmine white rice for many years, and thought I'd try this as it is healthier. I was very pleasantly surprised - it tasted great. I was concerned it wouldn't cook properly in my programmable Zojirushi 3 cup rice cooker but it comes out great on both the regular and quick cooking settings. (I haven't tried it in my bigger neurofuzzy cooker but assume it would be as good or better). It does seem a little more sensitive to amount of water than regular white rice - adding too much makes it mushier.<br /><br />I think it's the wheat and rye berries that make it delicious, so getting the brown/wild rice mix at Whole Foods and mixing in some wheat and rye berries would probably be just as tasty and less expensive."

I'm so hooked I drink two big mugs a day - one truly delicious vice.<br /><br />This coffee is strong and dark but not harsh or bitter. Other strong or ""full-bodied"" coffees often have a burned taste - as if burning the beans is the only way to add flavor to an inferior bean.<br /><br />Nescafe, the largest selling brand of coffee in Europe, has developed a fantastic coffee.

The texture was OK; I didn't have any problems with getting the crust to brown, or it being soggy in the middle. The problem was the taste, which I found somewhat reminiscent of bisquick.

Looking at the ingredient list I guess it should come as no surprise, since it contains egg, soy, and milk!<br /><br />My suggestion if you want a quick and easy homemade pizza crust without having to make the dough a day in advance, get some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004136MDG"">Fleischmann's Pizza Yeast</a> and follow the recipe on the packet (Amazon's price is ridiculously high, check your local supermarket instead).

17013,B004391I3C,5.0,"I was terribly excited when I heard that Nescaf&eacute; had finally decided to just touch on the idea of carrying a wide array of flavors and intensities for straight espresso (I've always been so jealous of Nespresso's collection of capsules) by introducing a new single-shot Intenso. As I've been stuck making double-shots of their fairly disappointing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA"">Espresso</a> option for ages, I've decided to do a little comparison in reviewing this new and exciting addition.<br /><br />This is what we're working with: the Espresso has 6g of coffee in each capsule, while the Dark Roast Caff&eacute; Grande has 10g. As I noted in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O"">Latte Macchiato</a> review: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee with the final shot sitting at no more than 35mL. The Espresso's instructions recommend ending up with 60mL of liquid, which seems to be a light amount of coffee for so much water (the Dark Roast doesn't do much better, recommending 200mL for 10g). For my taste-tests, I was able to pump out a fairly heavy 50mL single-shot espresso, while I kept the Dark Roast to about 150-160mL<br />(NOTE: the tips I give in the previously mentioned Macchiato review for really squeezing every mg of coffee out of these capsules I have a feeling only work with the Dolce Gusto machines that allow you to completely control the flow; while my machine has that ball-point silver lever pointing up out of the head of the dispenser (like the Melody 2 and Circolo), it seems the machines Nescaf&eacute; just released this past month (specifically the Creativa) are somewhat automated).<br /><br />Right off the bat, as I dispense the Grande I notice the thicker, creamier color and texture of the coffee, which it retains for a good 30 seconds until it settles into a deep brown with even less noticeable light passing through (compared to the Espresso). Even though my pour started pushing 160 mL, the thickness is far greater than the Espresso, with absolutely no hint of water. Literally, the liquid itself feels heavier and richer in your mouth. The Espresso just pales in comparison in regard to taste, aroma, and texture. I'm definitely not an expert when it comes to pinpointing descriptive flavors in espressos, but I'd say the espresso here has something between a sweet and bitter dominating taste. On the other hand, the Grande lacks any resemblance to the Espresso, and if anything I'd say there's a warm, spicy flavor that mixes quite well with the overall dark roast qualities.<br />Ofcourse, to those who know anything (and definitely more than me) about coffee, you might just say, 'Well, you're comparing a dark roast to a regular espresso'. Yes, I guess I am, and thus I should expect these differences. However, for the past three years now Nescaf&eacute; has only had one option when it came to a strong single-shot, the Espresso (the other choices were Caff&eacute; Lungo and then the Americano, both of which got further and further from deep and strong drinks). So, I guess giving this new Caf&eacute; Grande Intenso a try has ultimately given me a worthwhile competing option for the espresso-based choices. And I can finally enjoy a drink from my machine that only requires one capsule (the espressos could only do the trick in double-shots). For those of you who've been in a similar situation, this review should give you an idea of what to expect (and what you're missing out on!) with this new choice.<br /><br />As usual, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the Subscribe and Save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through Subscribe and Save), AND factoring in the 5 (sometimes 10) award points you get with every box (with which you may eventually redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 6 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br /><br />Nescaf&eacute; has finally entered the realm of differing strengths and flavors for its espresso line, and those who felt the brand's mild espressos just weren't quite hitting the spot, this is a must-have and will easily be my go-to single-shot drink from now on!"
253764,B003C1RIEK,2.0,"We have only had the Keurig coffee maker for a couple of months (yes, it was a Christmas gift) and my wife is the main user.  So, it's possible that the problem I'm having is common to other coffee/hot chocolate cups in addition to these Cafe Escapes.  At any rate, unlike many of the other reviewers, I think the hot chocolate flavor is pretty good.  My problem is that at least half the time I find a tiny piece of aluminum -- sometimes two tiny pieces -- floating on top of the chocolate in the cup.  The Keurig works, of course, by punching a small hole in the chocolate/coffee container.  I assume the tiny piece of aluminum is from the whole punched in the container.  I would guess that if the cups were properly designed, this wouldn't happen.<br /><br />I would also guess that there are times when the aluminum drops below the surface and I swallow it.  Probably not a major health risk ... but it can't be good!  At any rate, I won't be buying this brand of hot chocolate again.<br /><br />Edited on May 26:  Since I wrote this review, we have used a number of other brands of chocolate and coffee k-cups without encountering this problem.  Another user in commenting on this review notes that he or she has not had this problem with Cafe Escapes.  So perhaps it was just a defective batch."
150089,B003YBP6Q0,3.0,"There are so many hummus flavors out there that upon trying this and finding it bland with a sour aftertaste I was disappointed.  The crackers are the same multi-grain in several other gopicnics and are good but the roasted endamame...um...bland.  Dray and bland and sawdusty even.  Maybe if the main meal (hummus) had been flavorful these would have been a good side. No.  There are many flavors of endamame also on the market, why combine bland hummus with bland endamame??  I felt like I was eating a cardboard box.  The nut mix is good...it's also in the turkey sticks meal but the dark chocolate was a disappointment.  Mostly because it wasn't a more exciting dessert to reward you after eating a cardboard box for a meal.  Not even remotely interested in repurchasing."

241593,B0081XPTBS,2.0,"The only positive thing I have to say about this formula is that it has Organic Milk in it, and that's pretty sad because that part is a given.  Here are the negatives:<br /><br />- Dissolves horribly.  I have to prepare bottles ahead of time, refrigerate them, then warm them to use it.  My baby would take a bottle at room temperature, but if I did that there would be clumps of formula left behind.<br />- Has corn syrup in it (listed as Organic Glucose Syrup Solids).  Ok, so it isn't GMO corn syrup, but who cares?  There is no reason to include this except to save money.  It is a cheaper carbohydrate source than lactose, so they can use less lactose (lactose being something that actually has nutrional value).<br />-Has Palm Olein Oil in it.  Again, it is organic, but so what?  Another cheap ingredient (this time a fat source).  Palm Olein oil has been shown to block absorption of calcium in the body.  Oh good, because the first year of life isn't a crucial time for bone development or anything.  Even Similac won't use it.  Here is a link to study by the American Acadamy of Pediatrics from 2002(!) showing infants fed formula with palm olein oil had lower bone density than those without, and yet Hain doesn't care enough to stop using it: http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/111/5/1017<br />-Has Martec DHA/AHA in it.  This is a genetically modified product and the fact that it has been allowed in organic food is just an example of how powerful lobbyists are.  If they have to use chemical neurotoxins to get the DHA/AHA, I'd rather just do without, thanks.  I know of no studies that show the level of DHA/AHA in baby formulas do anything positive for a baby's brain development.  There have also been reports of babies experiencing stomach upset from DHA/AHA in formulas.  It is hard to get this feedback though since almost every formula has Martec's DHA/AHA in them now.<br />-It smells like death and when my baby burps in my face I gag a little.<br /><br />I never planned on even trying this formula, but Baby's Only constipated my baby like no tomorrow.  Even with the arsenic ridiculousness, I'd still use Baby's Only if the Brown Rice Syrup didn't make him scream every time he had a bowel movement.  And Similac Organic has no lactose and is filled with table sugar.  Organic formula options in this country are horrible.  (I am unable to exclusively breastfeed due to medication)"
126286,B000F8GWRM,1.0,"Ordered this item as I am a diabetic.  Decent tasting but absolutely indigestible. Caused major gastrointestinal distress.  Found hidden behind the fold a very subtle understated advisory that some individuals may experience a ""laxative"" effect.  Excuse me but this was way beyond ""laxative"" and lasted more than 18 hours!  This could replace the pre-colonoscopy medicine Miralax. Wait I might be on to something here! At least the the pre-op procedure would taste good.  I subsequently went back to the site and looked at the customer reviews and learned I am not alone in this experience.  Amazon needs to clearly advise customers of this potential in their product description.  Until they do I would hope they refund people who buy it  If you decide to try it after reading this, have a book and a roll handy and don't leave home."

If you are serious about getting fit, you would use real foods to NOURISH your body. This stuff is all sugar. A little planning ahead and stocking up on real fruits and vegetables will do the trick for a lot less money, and save your health in the long run. It actually didn't even taste good. Do some research, too, before buying anything like this. You'd be better off following Crossfit protocol and sticking to protein,fats, and minimal starches while avoiding simple sugars."

166416,B000IMSSHM,3.0,"I wish I'd known the ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips when I bought these (the ingredient list was not part of the product description as the time of this review).  There's no real cinnamon in them.  I had been using King Arthur's mini cinnamon chips previously (ingredients: sugar, palm oil, cinnamon, nonfat dry milk, soy lecithin) and was happy with them, but I was curious about Hershey's chips.  They were cheaper than King Arthur's, and I'd heard people rave about the Hershey's cinnamon chips.<br /><br />Well, curiosity killed the cat.  Now I have a lot of bags of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I don't want to use in my baked goods.....  I might end up using them if I'm baking something to give away where the person eating it won't know I made it.  I used my King Arthur chips in Cinnamon Chip Bread, great results, but when I switched to Hershey's, the chips kinda melt and get mixed a little with the bread dough, and that turned my bread YELLOW.  Artificial colors are on the ingredient list before the natural & artificial flavor.... that's a lot of  artificial color!  I usually don't care about artificial ingredients, I'm a junk food addict who drools at the sight of bright orange Doritos, but the yellow bread the Hershey's cinnamon chips made was displeasing.  Not to mention the flavor of the bread, which was negatively affected by the Hershey's chips.  Didn't have that same sweet cinnamon flavor that the King Arthur chips give.<br /><br />Why'd I give this product 3 stars instead of 1 star?  My husband didn't care about the changes in the bread, he'll eat anything I turn my nose up at, so he'll probably end up eating stuff I make for him with the Hershey's cinnamon chips.  Hopefully my bags of chips won't go to waste, but I won't buy Hershey's cinnamon chips again.<br /><br />Ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips:<br />Sugar; nonfat milk; partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (palm kernel and soybean oil); palm kernel oil; contains 2% or less of: cornstarch; artificial colors (Yellow 6 Lake; Yellow 5 Lake; Blue 2 Lake); natural and artificial flavor; salt; palm oil; soy lecithin."
17912,B001EO653M,5.0,We discovered a cafe that had excellent Mexican mochas about three years ago. They were expensive but we didn't visit that often. Then we discovered this was the powder used to make the mochas. It is all natural and tastes great. It is really rich and has nice spicy undertones. This is the cheapest way to purchase it in bulk.<br /><br />Now we make our mochas at home with an espresso machine and steamed milk. This also is loved by our children for hot chocolate.

While I continue to search for the ""right"" beans and/or ground Kenyan AA coffee by which to duplicate the ""real deal"", the appeal of K-Cups--for both home use as well as to insert in my office's Keurig machine--was too much to resist.  I was happy to find the Kenyan AA K-Cups on Amazaon.

With No Fear, Super Energy I would definitely consider drinking them on a regular basis. Most energy drinks taste like cough syrup to me but this one has a pleasant fruit taste. It was more like drinking fruit punch with a little kick. I didn't feel a zinging energy boost but I did manage to stay up later that evening after drinking the supplement at about 2:00 in the afternoon. I would recommend this for anyone who dislikes the taste of energy drinks like Monster or Red Bull and only need a slight energy burst but if you need a super boost of energy pass on No Fear."
82263,B000XJS6Z4,4.0,"I've been looking for a decent instant coffee, and since I like Greek coffee, decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it's not bad stuff -- but since I don't read Greek, it's taken a lot of experimentation with amounts to get the amounts right.  I find that if I don't use enough of the instant granules, I get a thin acidic cup, so I personally use about two tablespoons per cup of hot water.<br /><br />Remember that this is intended to taste like strong Greek coffee, not drip-brew, and is best taken with sugar, no cream.  I normally take my coffee black, but this doesn't taste quite right to me without a little sugar."

I use olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, for everything . . . I don't use butter or other oils anymore.<br /><br />Great product, well packaged for shipping, since Amazon likes to just toss things in a box without protecting anything.  This company thinks ahead, and the cans are very well protected for shipping.<br /><br />They are much smaller than they seem on the computer,  because of the shape, I guess.  Still a great value, even though they raise the price every order by about $2.00, so I probably will be shopping for another brand by next order.."

157055,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"Years ago, I purchased a hazelnut-flavored coffee that really pleased me, but the company that made it changed their formula to a flavor that tasted like alcohol with a little flavoring added.  Since then I've been hoping to find another hazelnut coffee as good as the old variety.<br /><br />Melita doesn't make it. In all fairness, it's just as good as the ones (only two) I can buy at my local grocery, but it's not better.  There is a faint flavor of hazelnut, but, for me, the taste that shouldn't be there (alcohol or something chemical) overwhelms the hazelnut.<br /><br />Will I buy it again?

You'll regret using it if you have any other source of salt in your dish, e.g., pasta cooked in salted water, feta cheese, brined olives, etc.<br /><br />I far prefer the pesto marketed under the ""Buitoni"" brand (Nestle foods) that is sold in the refrigerated foods section at the grocery store, as that pesto has excellent taste without going over-the-top on salt.  The Classico product has almost 50% more salt in the same size serving, relative to the Buitoni pesto.<br /><br />I have nothing against salt, or salty foods, but the amount of salt in this Classico pesto is unjustifiable and may well spoil your dish."

That was my logic behind this very amateurish but heartfelt video review starring my 1 1/2-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy.<br /><br />The video was very impromptu and, in hindsight, I realize that I didn't do a great job of explaining why I only gave the product 3 stars, so I'm adding some further explanation here.<br /><br />First, I took a star off because I felt that if you're going to make a multi-sized dog biscuit, the small should be small enough for the very small breeds like Yorkies and Chihuahuas.  As you can see in the video, this small biscuit is not only 2 inches long and quite thick but VERY hard, so I feel like a very small or more delicate breed may have trouble with even the small biscuit.<br /><br />Second, the ingredient list on the box is almost 3 inches long.  Sugar and salt are within the first 10 ingredients and, while there are a lot of vitamins and minerals included, there is also partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, several food colorings and chemicals I can hardly pronounce.  I just prefer to feed Missy more natural foods and snacks.<br /><br />Third, the ""feeding instructions"" (which hardly seemed necessary) direct me to give Missy 2 biscuits twice a day.  That's 4 large (compared to the small Mother Hubbard bone-shaped treats she usually gets) treats a day, which seemed a bit much, especially much considering my issues with the ingredient list."

Just read for yourself, there is no mention of any type of probiotic. Their statement ""Healthy Treat"" went by the wayside after they removed the probiotics.<br /><br />With the recent pet food scare, I would want to buy from a manufacturer who is aware of not only where they buy their ingredients, but of every tiny particle that is used in producing their product.<br /><br />So, use your judgement.

And I have enjoyed aloe drinks in the past.  This is a really cheaply made ""aloe vera"" product sold with a premium price tag.<br /><br />In general, the order of ingredients indicates the greatest percentage of the product. The ingredient list opens with water, cane sugar, and then ""Green Tea Infusion"" (green tea leaves and more water).  So I'm assuming they made a batch of green tea, and then diluted it with water before bottling it.  Then there is aloe vera, citric acid, and passionfruit flavor (but no actual passionfruit).<br /><br />The sample I received had pulp in it, but it tastes like orange pulp and not passionfruit.  And there is no indication from the ingredient label if this pulp is even supposed to be in the bottle.  The end result is watered-down weak tasting tea with slightly slimy pulp in it and an artificial citrus taste.  Yuck.<br /><br />Oh, and though a reasonable person would look at the bottle and think it was a single serving, it is labeled as 1 1/2 servings.  So the 80 calories listed on the label?

My vet recommended I stay away from Purina brand because there is much controversy surrounding them with all the recalls they've had in recent years on pet feed. I normally feed my pets Science Diet, but thought, since this was free, I would give them something different to try or something to snack on as a treat. Price isn't that bad, but it just doesn't seem that healthy for your pups. After what my vet told I wasn't going to feed it to my dogs but was curious to see if they would eat it. Pass on this.

Like most beverages, you'd have to taste it to see if it's to your liking as all that is so subjective.  Good tasting to you!"
136409,B006Q820X0,1.0,"I agree with many others here.  Very poor quality control and packaging.  You can actually see coffee residue embedded in the top of the K-cups, and most brews result in considerable grounds in the cup.  I have never had this issue with any other K-cup brands.  And worst of all, the coffee tastes as if the roaster simply filled it up with stale Folgers. And be aware that Amazon does not accept returns on K-cups."

They know that they need to change the Amazon picture."

240989,B000NBQUNW,2.0,"Some others have pointed out that the new formulation changed the shape, size taste and consistency of the chews.  But there are some more important changes you need to know about.<br /><br />  First of all, each piece contains less plant sterol esters (0.70 down from 0.85), but more sugars (4g up from 3g).  They have also added 50mg of calcium.<br /><br />  One study has shown that calcium in conjunction with plant sterols has beneficial effects on HDL and LDL. (Effects of calcium and plant sterols on serum lipids in obese Zucker rats on a low-fat diet - Timo Vaskonena, Eero Mervaalaa, Ville Sumuvuoria, Tuulikki Sepp&auml;nen-Laaksoa and Heikki Karppanena - British Journal of Nutrition 2002)<br /><br /> However, other studies indicate that calcium might be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer, possibly due to supressing Vitamin D levels.  All of this is still somewhat controversial, so I suggest you do your research before using this product."

At first taste you cannot distinguish these cookies from any other quality ginger snaps on the market.  They taste really good and have that amazing ""bite"" that real ginger gives.  Amazing.  Truly.<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies cannot ride on flavor alone.  They are really hard.  So much so, that chewing them hurt my teeth (and I'm an ice cruncher, if that tells you anything).  I was chewing so hard on these that I bit my lip and inner cheek just trying to manage these snaps in my mouth.<br /><br />If I can get the exact same taste in another brand, but not mangle my mouth and give myself a headache while chewing, I will go with a different brand."

77824,B001LG940E,4.0,"Switch Black Cherry is certainly 100% of what you want but it leaves you wanting more in the area of flavor.  It's 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all natural, carbonated with no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or colors.<br /><br />The flavor of the soda was refreshing yet it's all natural flavor was almost overpowering.  this beverage would be more attractive to kids that love to drink down soda bottle after bottle.<br /><br />On a flavor scale it ranks 9 out of 10 and on the sweetness scale it ranks 6 out of 10, certainly needing less sugar for my taste."
16889,B001LGGH40,5.0,"This is a great alternative to regular soda in the sense that aside from being carbonated just like a regular soda, it contains vitamins and no added sugar making it really a healthy alternative. Its sparkling appearance also adds to the attraction to this juice. The only downside I can think of for this is it is expensive. Other than that its very satisfying."

Also discovered that they make a really awesome iced coffee on a hot day.  I just make a pot, let it cool and put it in the fridge.  Just throw some ice in a glass and add sugar and cream to taste.  Everyone has a favorite flavor and that is just a matter of personal preference."
161891,B0002TR6YC,3.0,Three out of my four dogs like these.  They are OK but I use a different treat that I like better than these (all 4 dogs like) and it has the same benefits to skin and coat.  These treats are crunchy and my dogs prefer soft treats to these.
237919,B0017JFZ3U,2.0,"I bought these treats because I like to feed my dog hard treats for the tooth cleaning they provide, and I didn't like the idea of my dog eating treats that were predominantly grain.  I also like small (and breakable) treats so I can treat my dog for proper behavior several times a day.  These treats fit the bill for all of those reasons, so I bought them.<br /><br />Upon opening the bag I noticed a too-strong smoke odor.  My first thought was ""why?"" This can't be for the dogs, my guess it is probably to disguise something unpleasant.  My dog eats them readily enough, but I have found the product has two really negative side effects. First, it gives him really disgusting breath, I mean BAD.  Second, he smells them in his feces and sometimes decides to eat them - he doesn't ever do this when I feed other treats.<br /><br />I went back to Milkbone and both problems are solved..."

It was not shipped in any kind of climate controlled container, so  they are a little melted, not too bad by itself, but the package was crushed 6 ways from Sunday, all the cups  melted then got smashed, it's now a great big chore (more like hassle) to unwrap, making it very difficult to enjoy. I would not order anything like that from Amazon again, stick to books and electronics."
247410,B001EQ5SGU,2.0,"I was excited about it since it's from Finland, and they'va used Xylitol much longer than we did in the US. Well, actually native Americans used it too..., never mind ;). But, I was disappointed because:<br />1. it has glycerine, which is not good for teeth. google it if you want. other brands (I've tried 4 so far) don't have that.<br />2. a bit misleading labelling: they had the serving size = 2 gums, unlike other products. so, when you read 1.6 g of Xylitol, it's only 0.8 per gum. You can do better than that.<br /><br />I'm going back to another brand with higher Xylitol per gum, and no glycerine, for sure."

I didn't find any of the flavors that distinctive, however.  Yet I still maintain that for a quick, easy cup of decent coffee, Senseo is a good way to go.  And I'm the type that would rather drink flavored coffee than regular, so all else being the same, I recommend giving the flavor pods a try."
136478,B006Q820X0,1.0,"We preordered the 36 count Brooklyn Bean Roastery Fuhgeddaboutit K-cup product before it was released. When the order arrived the shipping and all packaging was perfect with no damage to any part of the order. When we began to brew the individual K-cups in our Keurig brewer there was a problem with grounds in the coffee and the brewer had a tendency to clog up using the Brooklyn Bean Roastery brand K-cup. The individual K-cups all seemed to be a normal size with no apparent damage. We have owned our Keurig brewer for several years and tried a large amount of other brands and coffee types without any problem. I'm not sure if this was a bad box or bad batch of the product, but we continue to use our brewer on all other brands with no problems."
246261,B004TTK84Q,2.0,"I ordered both the Green Tea and sorbet selections.  The sorbets are better than the Green tea, but I would not rate these products as premium.

I won't order again."

156827,B003DNMZA4,3.0,"Well, perhaps many people won't need to double it, but I really love the super-tangy flavor I get by mixing nearly an entire one of these little packets into a 18 glass loaded with crushed ice. If the price were much better I'd easily give this a 5 for flavor. There is no bitter aftertaste, unlike the Crystal Light Pomegranate Lemonade flavor, and--also unlike the Pomegranate variety--the lemon flavor is remarkably lifelike.<br /><br />Also docking the stars due to the artificial sweetener. I wish they could make something similar using stevia or at least mostly stevia, if the flavor suffers too much. After drinking over a gallon of this stuff a day for months I did beging to get muscle pain and weakness, but I'm not positive that wasn't just a co-incidence rather than the Aspartame. I tend to gain weight easily, so I reluctantly accept artificial sweeteners into my diet, always hoping stevia will continue to become more mainstream and that Crystal Light can give me that strong, tangy lemonade flavor without the Aspartame, sucralose, etc. Then again, who knows, it may be the tasty artificial lemon that proves deadly!"
80110,B007Z5VNLI,4.0,"This is a brand of orange pekoe black tea that is drunk all over the world. Lipton sells it in many countries, and while the product might have the same smooth, almost inoffensive base note, to me the UK version tastes very different than the Indian version, which is perceptable stronger and has a more ""citrusy"" note. While it doesn't hold up to some premium orange pekoe teas, it is distinctly better than the Lipton tea available in US supermarkets."
81137,B0043BAX5O,4.0,....Use it when you want something a little less tumeric-bright. One stop spicing if you're making a tanjine too. All the moroccan spices I ordered were surprisingly different from each other. So feel free to experiment.
80281,B004342XH2,4.0,I bought these for the kids and they love them.  Since it comes out too hot for them we put two ice cubes in the coffee cup and brew the hot chocolate on the 4oz size cup right over the ice.  It comes out at the perfect temperature for kids.

157846,B001SB2SPK,3.0,Will not order again and may not finish the ones I have here. These are not bad but just not very good either. I compare these to Bugles chips in taste.

79823,B001IZM92S,4.0,"The price on this product is great, compared to the other prices on the market. You will not get a true apple taste or texture like the freeze dried ones. However, your not paying $25 a pound. These are very crisp and do have a great apple taste with the slight sweetness you'd expect from a Fuji apple. There is peelings on the apple pieces but it doesn't seem to make them bitter. About half of the pieces will need to be handled and ate in the way you would peanuts; for an adult this is fine but not a small child. Personally, I found them great and have signed up to get them shipped every month. Being a diabetic, these are a great item. Low in carbs (6 carbs per 1/4 cup) and helps with sweet cravings."

17249,B005DM3N2M,5.0,"I used to drink Crystal Light over 10 years ago.  The choices were minimal:  Tea, tea with lemon, lemonade and pink lemonade.  At my job we have an area set up so employees can buy snacks and this variety pack.  Tired of soda, I opted to try the Crystal Light On the Go Wild Strawberry-Energy.  I instantly LOVED it.  This is coming from a person who really doesn't care for strawberries.<br /><br />Unlike another poster I didn't find it too strong.  I DO find the Cherry Pomegranate a tad powerful, but still yummy.  The last two-lemonade and raspberry lemonade- are also delicious.<br /><br />Having tried the Wild Strawberry at work I thought I'd see if Amazon had it and it did.  While I know purchasing an item this way is more expensive per serving, I prefer it this way.  When I make a pitcher of a drink I tend to get tired of it and it ends up going down the drain.  Now THAT is a waste of money!<br /><br />If you like Crystal Light then I'm pretty sure you'll like these flavors.  None of them are my favorite (I prefer fruit punch and pink lemonade) but I really like this product."
251500,B001E5DZYS,2.0,This coffee was stronger than I expected with a strange after taste. I have mixed it in with regular foldger's coffee to off set it.
75801,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"This is a berry flavored beverage that actually tastes like a berry drink. Most of the energy drinks have a chemically after taste and the flavors are weak and don't mask it well. The new taste that the advertisements are talking about is backed up by reality in this case. I shared it (it is a big can) with some of my friends who drink a lot of energy drinks including Monster and No Fear and they were also surprised by the flavor. Good news: the can shows only 1 carb per serving and lists no sugars. Not sure about that, but it's better than some competitors that have the equivalent of a dozen donuts worth of sugar!<br /><br />A huge down side is that a can of this has about 260 calories, which makes it one of the higher calorie energy drinks out there.<br /><br />Also, the caffeine in this drink is appx 87 mg per serving (2x each can) which is lower than some of the other energy drinks. So if you are going for caffeine for energy this one wont work. Admittedly, they are going for supplement energy from Creatine, Guarana, L-Carnitine and Taurine and you really ought to know what works for you before you start buying cases of this stuff.<br /><br />Overall, a much better flavor which will likely become a favorite for energy drinkers."
252048,B003VIL6BK,2.0,"I will never buy this product again.<br /><br />I really don't think these folks tasted their own product before it went out the door because they clearly don't know what chipotle is suppose to taste like. I'm from Texas and you can go into any Walmart and pick up and smell a bag of smoked jalapeno's to know the difference and it's nothing close to Ranch Style Beans. Apparently Pacific Foods must not visit Walmart.<br /><br />And oh, you can forget tasting anything that's even remotely close to sweet potato. No sweet. No potato.<br /><br />And the entire box contains 60% RDA DV in sodium. What they consider a single serving (which there are two in the entire box) wouldn't make a 10 turd.<br /><br />And something else just came to mind. Try opening the box. I dare you! Lift the corners up, squeeze the upper sides flat, grab one end and try to tear across two tightly glued poly-coated double ply chipboard.

77742,B001LG940E,4.0,"Switch fruit beverage promises ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't want"". To a large degree, Switch delivers on thst promise.<br />According to the ingredients list, it contains no sugar or corn syrup, however it does have a syruppy sweetness to it.<br />The Switch Black Cherry flavor product comes from concentrates of cherries, but also from grapes, apples and acerola (whatever that is). The light carbonation adds to the refreshment."
16805,B001LGGH40,5.0,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is one of the most refreshing drinks that I have ever tried. It is 100% pure kiwi and strawberry juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it, you may never go back to regular sodas again. It works well by itself or with a meal. This may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids, as it is a much more nutritious drink. The only problem that I have is the size of the can. At 8.3 ounces it may be enough for a kid, but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult's thirst."
158659,B001189I3A,3.0,"I have to admit, I don't track the results, so who knows if it's working, but I have no complaints.  It also smells amazing and the consistency is good. My only issue is that the pump is stiff, so you either end up getting nothing, or spilling out far more than you could ever use on two eyes in just one pump.  I feel like i put more energy into dispensing it than anything else.  Otherwise though, no complaints."
241010,B008EG58V8,2.0,"I like this cereal for its taste and sturdy crunch, but as with all cereals, it's imperative to read the side of the box to know what you're eating. Oatmeal, yes. But what makes it taste so good is nine grams of sugar. That's the same amount of sugar per serving as:<br /><br />1. Honey Nut Cheerios<br />2. Rice Krispie Treats cereal<br /><br />...and only two more grams than these classic sugar bombs:<br /><br />1. Frosted Flakes<br />2. Lucky Charms<br /><br />Keep in mind, too, that a ""serving"" is a measly cup. Make it a cup and a half and you're up to 13.5 grams of sugar. Yikes.<br /><br />For this reason, Quaker Oatmeal Squares is outlawed in our home. It's also incredibly expensive, when you compare it to a canister of real oats: 15 cents for a bowl of Quaker Oats, vs. $1.00 for a bowl of QOS, which lists sugar as five of its top seven ingredients (see list below).

249547,B001LGGH54,2.0,"By itself, Switch is excessively sweet -- ounce-for-ounce, it has considerably more calories and carbohydrates than Coke.  Don't be fooled by the ""natural"" ingredients into thinking this is a healthy alternative to soda, or that what you're drinking is watermelon juice.  Basically, it tastes like melted Skittles, and will appeal mainly to kids and junkies.<br /><br />On the other hand, you could treat it as a concentrate, and dilute it with a lot of seltzer and/or vodka to make a reasonable beverage for adults."

Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature.  I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. I add <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A"">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all.

I add <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ"">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNQV2Y"">TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs.

I place the mix in between hot tortilla with avocados for consumption. Now that does not mean that I am limited with these food selections since many times I may mix all those Tabascos together. Regardless, I have never been disappointed since it is truly delicious, spicy, hot without all the garbage and additives that it is out there in other brands without the taste. I have a very healthy diet and I consume healthy food without additives. Thanks and Double bravo to Tabasco."

16549,B0002DIBI8,5.0,"This is the food my vet recommends.  It is produced about 40 or 50 miles away from where I live, and they source only local ingredients, nothing comes from China.  So it is a food I feel very comfortable with, I know that this company cares about my pet's health and takes it seriously.  And it is very reasonably priced at one of my local pet food stores.  Now, there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable.  But my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with Eagle Pack.  He seems to do best on the Lamb variety and the Duck variety.  The Turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason.  I think the price and quality make us both happy, for now.  I'd love to feed him the optimal diet (probably raw) but I still have some reservations about it that I would have to come to terms with, so for now, we're sticking with this."
77576,B001LG940E,4.0,"As I've said about other flavors of Switch, it certainly lives up to its name. It is indeed a switch from your normal soft drinks. Packaged like an energy drink and served up like a fruit juice Switch manages to be a little of both. Some people might find their drinks a little sweet, but without a clinging aftertaste or sticky, sugary residue, it is actually quite refreshing.<br /><br />Switch's Black Cherry is one of the few Black Cherry flavored drinks that actually tastes like Black Cherry. The difference is subtle, but it is there, and it is noticeable. Black Cherry fans are sure to want to stock up on this liquid treat."

We were craving pancakes, and after seeing this mix, I ordered it. The taste - was slightly bitter, and no where near what the traditional ones are like. I'd get it, if you want to try to add your own ingredients, potentially altering the nutritional content but enhancing the taste - but honestly, steer clear and just take a bite of a real muffin if you feel you can't go without."
75511,B0014ET2XM,4.0,"I have gotten this product before a number of times, as we use it frequently. It is so much better price-wise than the markets. I only gave it 4 stars this time, because of the packaging. It was sent via the Post Office, before it was always UPS. Somewhere along the route, the box practically fell apart and had to be taped up by the postal carrier on our route. Also, a couple of cans were dented in pretty good. Of course, it's hard to tell who was faulty here, but I won't stop buying the soup. A good deal!"

136444,B006Q820X0,1.0,"I love a good strong cup of coffee - my favorite K-Cup is the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Extra Bold, but I'll try any of the extra bold varieties and enjoy most of them.  So the ""Fuhgeddabboudit"" flavor intrigued me and I pre-ordered a box of 36 cups.  Took about a month to arrive, and I just tried it this morning.<br /><br />First off, the people talking about these things making messes on the counter aren't kidding.  The very first cup leaked all over the place, and gave me a cup full of grounds.  I was almost reluctant to try another one - something like that can't be very good for your Keurig machine - but gave it a shot.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, but it didn't measure up to the Double Black Diamond, and since it's essentially the same price, why shouldn't I get the stuff I really like instead?  I found the flavor a little thin, lacking the richness of a DBD cup.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />The real trouble is, I'm reluctant to play K-Cup Roulette with these, given that lots of people are apparently having this same issue.  I believe I'm going to contact Amazon about returning these - I'm not willing to risk screwing up my $150 Keurig with poorly-made defective K-Cups.<br /><br />The people at Brooklyn Bean Roastery need to pay a little more attention to quality control.  There's really no excuse for this sort of rampant shoddiness in their products.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon refunded my money without even wanting me to return the K-Cups.  Once again Amazon's superb customer service takes care of a problem and makes a customer happy.  If only all businesses were so easy to deal with and focused on doing whatever it takes to satisfy their customers."
134301,B0055ZRVTI,1.0,"I've had Intelligentsia coffee before and it's excellent. But I should have ordered directly from the company. For one thing, the product page here doesn't tell you that these beans are pre-ground. But the main problem is that they are FIVE MONTHS OLD. The label on the bottom says they were roasted in May. I brewed a cup and it was undrinkable. And I just learned that it is unreturnable. 13 dollars wasted."

The product lists far more carbs than any other packaged coconut water I have tried. Given these two things, I'm thinking it's likely this product is boiled, or otherwise condensed.  This may be good for those weaning off sugary beverages, but if you are looking for a coconut water that tastes like fresh from the coconut, this is not it."
148613,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"These Planters Big Nut Bars are just so-so.  They're not sweet enough to be super-yummy, and not boring enough to be just normal peanuts.  They're right in between.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the sweeter taste of some of the other bars on the market such as the Nature Valley line.<br /><br />The size of these bars is pretty big, though, and certainly bigger than their competitors.  Too big?  I wouldn't say that.<br /><br />Size aside, they could have fit 5 extra bars in the packaging if they just turned them a different direction.  Odd.<br /><br />One complaint: the wrapping around the bars is difficult to open without: 1) tearing it into shreds, and 2) getting peanut butter all over your fingers.  I don't seem to have this problem with other bars of a similar nature.<br /><br />And as other reviewers have noted, these are far from being a ""healthy snack""... unless your alternative is a Pop Tart."
126421,B001PO7FDU,1.0,"I've had good truffle oil before but this isn't it. I think one of the other reviewers comments about the taste of this was due to the plastic taste, not truffle oil in general. The metal cans are lined with plastic and it tastes as if it leached into the oil."
237510,B001EQ55KE,2.0,"I purchased this as an alternative to the popular Japanese furikake because the Asian version incorporates sugar in all of their varieties, which I don't like. However, my glee at finding a sugarless version was soon cut short once I was able to inspect the contents in person. The ingredient list boasts of sesame seeds, seaweed, and pickled shiso leaves, but the last two ingredients are so disproportionate as to negate the necessity of even listing them except to highlight possible allergens.<br /><br />Seasame seeds, sesame seeds...both black and traditional versions...with a flake here or two that might be seaweed. Not that my tastebuds could tell. You're honestly just better off buying a bottle of sesame seeds and tossing in a sprinkle of salt.<br /><br />While not a direct commentary on the company itself (I really like their umeboshi), I think it's sad that they felt the need to Westernize this delightful condiment by eliminating or reducing the tastiest parts."

125116,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"I have been a regular consumer of Lindt Excellence 70% cocoa Dark Chocolate bar for years and have recommended it to many people, not only for the wonderful taste and texture, but b/c of the purity of this product (only four ingredients, including natural bourbon vanilla beans that gave it a most delicious flavor). My most recent purchase ... their ""new recipe,"" as stated on the label, was quite a shock to my taste buds. By adding soy lecithin to the recipe, they are now producing a bar that is not only tasteless but has a waxy texture that I find disgusting. I can only conclude that the soy has replaced some of the more costly ingredients, thereby becoming cheaper for Lindt to produce. Apparently, this has happened only since Lindt started producing the bar in the U.S. and the original formula is still in use in France and Canada but they will not ship it to the U.S. I am extremely disappointed in Lindt for this change and will never buy this product again, unless they go back to the original recipe. What a shame that lovers of dark chocolate have lost the opportunity to enjoy this formerly great product. And let me add that you didn't have to be a connoisseur of dark chocolate to know just how great this product was...all it took was one bite!"
77733,B001LG940E,4.0,"This is a pleasant combination of a very tangy texture lift to juice. I liked the flavor and would drink this beverage on a regular basis. I must point out that it's really not a 'unique' drink. My husband described it as simply a 'carbonated juice' texture, but we both liked the flavor. If you prefer carbonated, sparkling juices and drinks with an extra boost in the 'fizz factor', you'll enjoy Switch. At zero fat and high vitamin C, it's a better choice than many drinks on the market and could easily replace my soda pop craving.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author"

I also squirted some light whip cream in it and over it. After trying the undrinkable Gevalia cappaccino, I was relieved to find something I liked. The creamer isn't bad in this one. I don't know if it's a different kind or if it is a good combination of seasoning. I gave it 3 stars because for this price, Twinings should have used a better grade of tea. It tastes pretty good now, but there is still that lingering aftertaste of earthy tea. With the milk, it fills my insulated glass 3/4 of the way full. One other feature, it smells wonderful brewing! It IS Thanksgiving in a cup (thermal glass, I mean.) As a price comparison, using the 20% coupon at Bed, Bath, & Beyond, who sells it for $10.99, regularly, for the 16 disc (8 servings) pkg. and with their free standard shipping, it comes to $1.09 per serving before tax."
150870,B000EVSYI0,3.0,"Compared with the black licorice Haribo, this product seemed not as soft and fresh.  Some pieces also seemed to have an unpleasant chemical taste to them.  It's hard to know whether this was just a stale package or if the formulation differences between the licorice flavor and strawberry flavor cause the significantly worse texture in the strawberry product, but if one really loves strawberry licorice, you can still manage to enjoy this product.  Overall, somewhat disappointing.  Not sure that I would buy this again."
77334,B002L3RVBA,4.0,"My wife bought Wilton Food Writer edible pens for decorating cake balls/pops and was extremely disappointed.

They all carry Americolor coloring along with Wilton but only Wilton pens.  When she received the AmeriColor pens she was please to find they did exactly what she needed.

161094,B000E1694G,3.0,"I thought that adding ginger to chicken soup was pleasantly tasty, but it was a bit bland. I wish this had more ginger flavor. If you dont have MSG, or more salt, you gotta add something. The vegetables were still pretty hard - I cooked it by adding boiling water and waiting 3 minutes. Also, there was a very small amount of pieces of vegetables. I think even one or two actual slices of mushroom would increase the perceived value greatly. The noodles reconstituted nicely, as they do with all versions of these soups, and there was a nice serving of them. I would have liked to see maybe even slightly less noodles if it meant more vegetables. An optional spice flavor packet would be really nice too.<br /><br />I didnt think this was bad but I wasnt that impressed. This would probably be improved with a little soy sauce or spice. I know they are trying to limit the salt but i've had other soups with 1000mg of sodium (the amount in this soup - they claim 2 servings but thats a joke and deceives many people) or less, and it tasted better. Also, when cooking, do not use more water then specified. 1 cup is enough; any more will substantially dilute the taste. I would recommend trying this once but after that, unless its $1.50 or less, I dont think its a repeat for me.<br /><br />I saw this at my local publix for - get this - a whopping $4.79. Its certainly NOT worth that price. With annie chun you are partly paying for the gimmick - the cornstarch recyclable packaging, charity donations, organic ingredients, no msg (although does contain yeast extract which has free glutimates I believe..), etc.<br /><br />My recommendation is to only pick this up if you see it on sale, and then add in something extra - maybe even more ginger. If you are able, some diced chicken would really improve this soup. If you are on the go, you could also add canned chicken breast since its shelf stable. I think the overall consensus is that if you were to try any one of these annie chun soups, try the udon."
245112,B001O8NLV2,2.0,This tea is as awesome as everyone says it is.  I swear by it.  Only thing is that you can get this tea at your local grocery store for under $5 for a 20 count box.  Anything over that price is not worth it.

Forgive me if I don't take anyone's word on that, and why would I want to eat glue anyway when I'm paying extra for a healthy alternative.  No thanks.  I buy Back To Nature mac & cheese products now and will remain with these as they have the added benefit of employing vegetarian friendly enzymes in their cheese culture, as opposed to Annie's which does not uses animal enzymes."

Not exactly the flavors you are looking for in June, either.<br /><br />The only good thing to come out of this mess is that it introduced me to a single cup of wild blueberry which was delicious. I'll be sure to order a carton of just that in the future and stay away from the so-called ""sampler"" packs on amazon, which are obviously just a method for sellers to offload unpopular or outdated flavors."

And there is no ""best by"" date on this package to refute my claim.<br /><br />Since purchasing the Hario grinder and the Aerobie press, in July of this year, I enjoyed two other very good French roasts from ""Just Coffee,"" purchased at my local cooperative grocery (yes, organic), and one purchased here, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001KL1YI"">Volcano Dark Roast, Organic Kona Hawaiian Coffee, 8 Oz, Whole Bean</a>. Every last cup brewed from these was heaven. During that time, I periodically washed the Hario grinder to remove the coffee oil buildup whenever I would begin to detect the effects of rancidity, and before trying this batch from Altura, I washed it again. So I know that everything necessary for a great cup of coffee was in place and ready to go.<br /><br />Except the beans this time were the deal breaker. A brew using freshly ground coffee beans stored in vacuum canisters should not taste bitter. The first cup was reminiscent of gutter water. I will not be falling for this again.<br /><br />To Amazon's credit and with my deepest gratitude, customer service responded to my feedback. But in all honesty, I believe this product should be removed from sale here."
77593,B001LG940E,4.0,"Having now tried several Switch drinks, I'm quite pleased with how they've chosen to enter the market with this product-line. The flavors they've introduced are well thought out, generally taste good, and are really a good set of drinks I'd consider purchasing.<br /><br />The downsides? It's probably not big enough. 8.3 ounces is quite small. I know it's probably more of a specialty drink, but I did feel like I still needed more after drinking the entire can. It's possible they intended that to make you purchase more.<br /><br />That being said, this flavor, black cherry, was by far my most favorite. Again, these are great drinks. Definitely worth trying and seeing if they can become a part of your regular drink selection."
82697,B005UP1M4I,4.0,"These empty plastic capsules and precut foil lids work just fine in the Nespresso Pixie I have. Their cost is much less than the filled ones purchased from Nespresso, but you do have to fill them - and you need to purchase high quality coffee or you won't get a high quality cup o' joe.  For a little work and a much lower price, I say, ""Go get 'em!""  They're easy to fill and easy to use. I bought 'em on Amazon."
16535,B003VZCZ0O,5.0,WOW! Not much to say. Its cereal just as if it is on the shelfs at stores but at a way cheaper price. I love these since I was a child and still eat them to this day. Got to love em'.
77894,B001EO5YKW,4.0,"I love India Tree and wish this was organic and non-GMO. However for occasional use I will overlook that. India Tree fondant sugar is 100 times finer than regular powdered sugar and that does make a difference in icings and other decorations. I used it for royal icing on sugar cookies.  One caveat: I was really annoyed that their recipe calls for 1 lb. or 1.25(!!) packages of the stuff meaning you have to buy 2 packages worth. Why on earth don't they provide a recipe for a single package of fondant sugar rather than 1.25??? I don't usually need a calculator when I follow a recipe so that was really annoying. And don't bother substituting regular powdered sugar to make up the difference ~ your icing tip will clog, clog, clog."
17733,B000Z978SS,5.0,"Erythritol tastes like sugar, just like xylitol.  It is not, however, toxic to pets as xylitol is.  Also, it does not have the gastrointestinal effects (bloating, gas, etc.) that can come with intake of large quantities, as is the case with xylitol.  Both are quite safe for people, however.  Dogs cannot eat chocolate, either, due to toxicity, so xylitol is just another thing that works for us but not for them.  But erythritol is safe for both people and animals.<br /><br />The downside to erythritol is that it costs more than xylitol and is only 70% as sweet as sugar, whereas xylitol is closer to being the same sweetness as sugar.<br /><br />I haven't had much luck baking with either of them -- but maybe others have had different experiences.<br /><br />Both xylitol and erythritol taste great - I can't tell them from sugar.  Stevia is also a healthy sugar alternative, but it definitely has a taste -- not pleasant in large amounts (bitter).<br /><br />Not all brands of xylitol and erythritol are equal.  Many come from birch trees which often is extracted using sulfuric acid.  The ones from NOW Foods are from corn, which does not require sulfuric acid.<br /><br />This is a good company and I have been very happy with them.  On the other hand, I did not have a good experience with Emerald Forest's products or customer service.  Their products come from birch trees and have a very unpleasant odor.  I much preferred the products from this company - they taste great and don't really have an odor."
133074,B0090X8IPM,1.0,"Yes, I did smell the vanilla (and even saw it) when I opened the bag and pour the contents out. However, once the coffee was made, the taste was a disappointment to myself. Perhaps I got used to another coffee which was much more to my liking. In any case, not only did this coffee taste bitter to me, but the vanilla taste was weaker than I expected (again, this is in comparison to another vanilla-flavored coffee I've had, which gave me a stronger vanilla ""experience""). This Starbucks product is pretty strong coffee (the instructions tell you to use 2 TBS of ground coffee for 6 ounces of water) and to my taste - seems quite bitter if I follow their instructions. However, once I add some milk to it, the bitterness is masked somewhat - but I would not drink this black if I have a choice. Personally, I would not buy it myself or recommend this product to a friend."
246571,B002D4DY8G,2.0,"With a legendary name like Gevalia, I was disappointed to find that the coffee contains artificial flavors.  The outside packaging looks gourmet and epicurean, with gold lettering.  Unfortunately, artificial flavoring also plainly occupies the front face.<br /><br />The aroma from the coffee is quite pleasant, however, after brewing, the coffee itself is nothing to write home about.  In fact, it tasted rather bitter.<br /><br />I would not buy this item."
77841,B001LG940E,4.0,"Hmm, at first, I thought this was another one of those beverages competing with Red Bull.

That is the question of the day.<br /><br />The Switch contains 100% fruit juice and none of the other stuff.  It's just carbonated juice.<br /><br />However, I didn't really quite catch that 'black cherry' flavor.  It tasted more like apple juice than anything else.  Nonetheless, it was still good!"

136451,B006Q820X0,1.0,"The coffee tastes fine if only the K-cup would work. I think they are faulty, as all the grounds go into the coffee and spill out around the machine.

16808,B001LGGH40,5.0,"I've tried three flavors of this product so far:  Black Cherry, Watermelon Strawberry, and Kiwi Berry.  My favorite so far is Kiwi Berry that I thought was very good.  Watermelon Strawberry was second, and Black Cherry was a distant third.<br /><br />This product has a lot going for it, in my opinion.  100% fruit juice, so healthier than soda, but with added carbonation to make it different than just plain juice.  To me, the amount of carbonation was just right - I was able to drink it quickly and found it very refreshing.  The serving size is good, too.<br /><br />I do wish that it was available in larger sizes, even if someone didn't want to drink it all at once.<br /><br />My rating for the flavors, based solely on my personal opinion, is:<br />Kiwi Berry:  5 stars - would buy again<br />Watermelon Strawberry:  4 stars - would drink again, but probably won't buy again<br />Black Cherry:  3 stars - would drink again if very thirsty, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it"

16941,B003YNGRIY,5.0,"On my third trip to work on Hawai'i (the island), Summer of 2010, I was determined to seek out the best Kona coffee. The $20/lb Morning Thunder at Costco was OK, but really not as good as the Guatemalan or Mexican coffees so common and inexpensive in my area, and certainly nothing to compare to Ethiopian Moka-Sanani, which I felt to be the best when properly roasted.<br />I tried a lot of roasts from small farms, recommended by friends, purchased in small stores, studied on-line...<br />I was getting closer, but the best of it was still a nice light little cup, like Tanzanian peaberry.<br />One day I was visiting some friends of a friend, sort of a community. It was lunchtime, and one of the guys asked if I would like a cup of coffee. I've been disappointed pretty regularly, but something in his eyes told me to say ""yes"". They poured it out of a big 5# bag and brewed it in a big drip maker.<br />I had no particular expectations, but when I took the first sip I was immediately enchanted.<br />This is very good! I exclaimed. What is it?<br />""This is what we grow here, the B-grade"", he said...<br />I have been drinking a cup every morning since then, no matter what the distance, no matter what the price.<br />This is my new ""best coffee in the world"". There is even more complexity to the art of what they do growing and hand processing (and aging) these beans than you will ever find online. (And they only sell the ""A-grade"")"
78304,B001AYDDCC,4.0,"My Japanese friend introduced me to this and I was instantly hooked! GREAT aroma and taste and SO easy to make. Simply throw some rice into your rice cooker, boil this pre-made curry sauce (with veggies) in boiling water and soon as the rice is done, cut open the packet and pour over your rice! Love this stuff. If you would rather use fresh veggies (even though the carrots and potatoes included in this packet are pretty good for pre-packaged veggies), you can simply purchase just the solid-type (bouillon) curry mix by S&B and it works the same. Then just throw in your own meat and veggies and it comes out just as good.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

154820,B0013M07PW,3.0,"These bars hold together better and are loaded with healthy ingredients,very filling.  They are a better texture than some of the other granola bar flavors, but I could do without the ""syrupy"" taste."
240217,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"The Beneful bag is quite striking showing lots of fresh veggies leading a person to think that it would be chock full of veggies and vitamins which would be good for a dog.  Unlike another reviewer who claimed it had neither meat or veggies I did read farther down the ingredients list.  The very first ingredient is ground yellow corn.  Well, ok corn is a veggie but it is not what I want to see as the first ingredient in my dog's food.  Chicken by-product meal is the next item which I suppose could qualify as ""meat"" but is it ground beaks, bones, feathers, or what?  The fourth item is whole wheat flour so that covers the wheat shown on the bag.  Where's the beef you may ask?  Beef is listed as the 7th ingredient but I'll give you dollars to donuts that it isn't ground sirloin.  To get to the carrots and peas you'll find them listed as ingredients 19 and 20.<br /><br />Now that we have that sorted out, did my dogs like it?  I have four dogs in my house and we have an open-feeding system.  The dogs include an Australian Kelpie, a Kelpie/Heeler mix, a older Yellow Lab and a beautiful and very active 75 lb. Heinz 57.  Over the years I've fed them  everything from Ol' Roy Complete to some very expensive premium dog foods.  The only food they seemed to universally dislike was the Science Diet brand.  When feeding them the Purina Beneful I saw some interesting behaviors.  The Lab is picky about her food and I found her taking small bites and spitting out the pieces she didn't like.  The Kelpie/Heeler mix starting taking a mouthful of food from the bowl, taking it to the living room, dropping it then sniffing each piece eating what he liked the smell of and leaving the rest.  Only the Kelpie and the Heinz 57 seemed to eat normally and the Kelpie would go over and clean up whatever the Kelpie/Heeler had left behind.<br /><br />Because of the behavior of my dogs I don't believe the Beneful is something I'm going to continue to feed them.  When 2 of them pick at their food and only eat what they like there is a possibility they won't be getting all of the nutritional benefits of the food.  As a side note, I also have 3 cats.  Two of them loved picking through the Beneful picking out the softer pieces.  I don't promote cats eating dog food since it can actually be harmful to their systems, but thought it was curious that 2 of them investigated this dog food.<br /><br />In conclusion.  I don't plan to buy this to feed my dogs for several reasons and for each reason deducted a star from the possible 5-star rating.  Corn (probably in meal form) is the first ingredient.  Two dogs obviously found pieces they didn't like and wouldn't eat them.  Thus the deduction of another star.  Finally, the cost/benefit ratio just isn't there.  If I chose to I could buy Ol' Roy Complete for them at Walmart which actually lists more vitamins and has a somewhat similar list of ingredients.  Also the Ol' Roy is a 44 lb. bag which sells for about 25% less than the 15.5 lb. Beneful.  As is, I'll stick with the Premium brand I currently buy for them.<br /><br />Sorry Purina, this one just didn't cut it in my house."

127757,B001BOVE54,1.0,"After reading reviews, I was excited to get this food for my 14 year old cat.  He is not a picky eater and has always enjoyed dry food - some more than others, but he never turns his nose up at it.  Except this food.  He will not touch it.  Plus, I have to question the freshness of the product being shipped from Amazon - the bag of food was very meal-like - in other words, much of the small nuggets were no longer whole - but had turned to meal.  A total waste of $40+ dollars.  Makes me rethink ever buying something that needs to be guaranteed fresh - from Amazon.  Who knows how long stuff sits on those warehouse shelves."
124919,B005BHIESC,1.0,"I purchased this thinking ""what a great deal!"" Now I know why it was, and it really is a bad deal! First off, several containers were defective. The top parts were not secured (they flipped up), so the screw off top wouldn't work properly. Second, really didn't like the taste. Thought I would as I love the Peach/Mango, but this is awful, doesn't taste @ all like tropical fruit! Perhaps, this was just a fluke (defective bottles, bad taste), & I realize all tastes are different, so some may like it. The defects were just insult to injury...  Turned out to be a big waste!"
79753,B0025UCI94,4.0,"I ordered a package of 6 cans previously, and that order was completed as I hoped. So when I bought this order of 12 cans, I was expecting more of the same. However, of the 12 cans, 6 were dented, and 4 of them badly. It doesn't appear the seals were broken and the cans aren't swollen, etc, so the bread is fine. But based on the other reviews, anyone about to buy this product needs to be aware of the condition it might be in when you receive it.<br /><br />As for the bread itself, it is delicious. It's very dense and fairly sweet. It goes well toasted with butter or with peanut butter (to my taste buds, anyway). This stuff isn't available in stores here in Texas to my knowledge, so I'm glad I can buy it on Amazon!"

77640,B001LG940E,4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this drink.  It really doesn't have any added sugar, and the flavor is very natural.  The carbonation is light, so if you're looking for something with a lot of kick, this might not suit you.  But I think it compliments the fruit flavor nicely.<br /><br />Two things took me aback:  First, that the can was just a bit over 8oz, which is small for those of us used to normal-size carbonated beverage cans.  And second, in spite of having no added sugar, it's really quite sweet.  I found it almost too sweet for my taste.<br /><br />It's a nice change from soda, but given the amount you get for the price, I don't think it's a great deal."
254873,B007PA32L2,2.0,"Like others have said it is very weak. I would mix it in with something else but it might cut the pumpkin spice and that part actually tastes ok. It does say on the top of the K-cup ""light roast coffee"" (but not on Amazon description that I could find) so buyer beware."
77599,B001LG940E,4.0,"This does taste like cherries and is all natural.  Of course, every all natural fruit juice is sugary, so this is going to be just as sugary and have just as many carbs as apple juice.<br /><br />Switch is simply fizzy soda water with fruit juice, which normally I love, but the taste of this cherry soda is just a little too sweet.  Most juices are cut with a certain amount of apple juice and Switch is no exception, but I think there is too much apple in this drink.  It gives the whole thing a cloying flavor.  There is a bit of aftertaste, too.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars, but would rather give 3.5 if there was that option.  It's better than 3, but not quite a 4."
237743,B00337P71Y,2.0,"First, the good;  Not having to run outside into the rain to check the temperature of what I'm cooking is genius.  It also has preset temperatures for the meat type you are cooking, be it chicken, fish, beef, lamb, etc.<br /><br />Now, the bad;  Aside from the Beef setting, there is no way to set what your desired cooking level would be.  For instance, if you want to pull the chicken out a little earlier than the thermometer recommends, you have to watch it constantly and not rely on the alarm.  For Beef, you are allowed to set rare/medium/etc.<br /><br />Finally, it stopped working after about four months, and nothing I've done wants to revive it.  We bought ours from Brookstone, and they haven't responded to our queries for help.  Two stars max."

When I came home I sought out the real deal here in the states, I guess I did not look very far but I did come up with this pretty good substitute.  I also like the other brand of Mexican chocolate, I tried them side by side and they are almost exactly the same.<br />I love the texture and I often, more than not, eat it just the way it is right from the package.  But to make a good Mexican cocoa you need to use a paddle and put the chocolate in the cup, pour over the hot milk and paddle it till it is melted and foamy.  You do not need to microwave it, yuck!  You do not have to put it in the blender, Mexican people, for the most part, do not use blenders for their hot cocoa.  I buy it at the store it is too expensive here."

They're too small and fall right out with almost no effort on her part, which -- I want her occupied! The pieces are also too small to be used as treats; each is about the size of a small pill or long grain of rice. To keep the pieces from falling out immediately, I usually seal the opening of the Waggle with peanut butter before I give her the toy.<br /><br />The chicken flavoring grosses me out; it reminds me a little of cereal ""icing"" the way it coats each piece.<br /><br />Regardless, I'm not disappointed in the product per se, we're still using it, and my dog has no complaints."

The dog in my life did seem to like it but there are healthier products on the market.<br /><br />While the bag is sturdy and resealable, I did not have a pleasant experience with Amazon's delivery which lowers my score.

Who cares about the taste anyway? Go buy some candy if your looking for the taste. As far as the price, I have about 40 or so left from my shipment that if figure is a complete waste of money.

I am fairly certain these cups contain instant coffee.  I think that for a few reasons 1) if you shake these cups they have a distinctly different sound than K-cups of other types that I have.  It's as though the contents are dehydrated and take up significantly less space in the cup than the others; 2) The coffee comes out of the machine initially as dark sludge, then as almost clear water.  Obviously these extremes mix together in the mug; and 3) the flavor reminds me a lot of instant coffee.  Not undrinkable, but not something I would buy again, even if it were on sale."

132895,B004N0HIUI,1.0,"First, I happened to be the customer who told them their declared weight was wrong on this product. It used to be listed (here on Amazon as well as on Pamela's own website) as .7 ounce each. In fact, each packet, a single cookie, is .2 ounce or slightly more, so they still don't have it correct. After lengthy email and phone correspondence they sheepishly admitted the error in weight. You could say this is not worth troubling oneself over, but that's more than three times exaggeration, .7 to .2, so the goal of truth in advertising should have straightened them out. (If you order these cookies and have a postal scale, you can weigh them yourself; you won't find them weighing in at .43 ounce, I'm pretty certain.)<br /><br />Second, before I had finished corresponding with the company, I had ordered this product (100 packets of .7 ounce each). I had tried them in the other package they offer, I believe 7 full ounces (now that I think about that, I wish I had weighed that package's contents). Extreme chocolate really did describe the cookie. BUT, these individual packets contain stale, or at least, very, very dry cookies; nothing at all like I'd tried before.<br /><br />Try them if you want, but be prepared to ask Amazon for credit. I did."

17683,B00390BRVE,5.0,"I must admit I'm not a fan of the brewed coffee at Starbucks. It has a one-note taste to me, and that taste is: Burnt. I'm not even a fan of most of their beans. There are only two blends they sell that I love: The Christmas Blend (a little different every year, but always good) and this one. It doesn't have that heavy, dark, bitter signature Starbucks taste, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll be disappointed. It's mild and bright, which is just what I want when I go down to my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005IBX9"">Cuisinart Brew Central</a> at 6 AM for a cup. Because of this blend's mildness, I always add an extra tablespoon or two to the pot, to make the flavor a little richer. It's not necessary, but I think it improves the taste.<br /><br />Incidentally, darker roasts do not have more caffeine, even if psychologically they seem to have a bigger ""kick."" This blend may be easy to drink, but it's got plenty of punch in the caffeine department -- my definition of a ""good morning""!"

Upon unpacking the cans and cleaning them up, she discovered two more cans that were leaking around the lid. Over the next couple of weeks she opened two more cans which were good.  Then opened one that was completely spoiled, most likely from a tiny leak that was not noticed.  There are still 6 more cans that are unopened.  They appear to be ok.<br />When my mother received the order, she tried to do a review on the packaging but wasn't allowed because it hadn't  been ordered as a ""gift"" to her.  She procrastinated in complaining to me, and when she did, I was handling family emergencies and did not go online to review the packaging.<br />Final summary - the soup is delicious, the packaging is terrible!"
126680,B003IHO8LY,1.0,"Bought this for my wife. She tried half a bottle to start, still had trouble falling asleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweat with her heart racing and very uncomfortable. Product is NOT returnable. If you try this and you don't like it or have problems you are out of luck."
17843,B0001FQVCA,5.0,"I am in love with this hazelnut spread made with skim milk and cocoa.  Grownups and kids both enjoy and it's a nice way to get picky eaters to consume whole grain breads.  Don't let the healthy breakfast commercials fool you, there is a ton of sugar in the recommended serving size.  My answer to that is that I don't indulge in the recommended serving size of two tablespoons.  You can get by with less and it's still a tasty way to start the day.  I am hooked on this stuff and my local market doesn't always have it in stock.  I went to two stores that didn't have it and resolved to buy it here on Amazon.  Big jar, twice the size of the tiny ones at my local stores.  It should last me a while but next time I'm ordering double jar package!"
149266,B004MTTY3O,3.0,"This is a high price for a two ounce tin of mint fragments.  The flavors are OK.  They are sweetened with xylitol which does not promote tooth decay and has some benefits as it supresses the growth of bacteria.  I guess you could call them small breath mints.  The small size tin can be carried in a purse, shoulder bag, or coat pocket (as long as you are not flying on an airplane)."
17775,B001EQ4LAE,5.0,"I picked these up because my wife is trying (sort of) to eat gluten-free.  She loves these brownies, and I have to admit that they are pretty good.  Maybe not quite as good as ""real"" brownies, but still pretty good."

240646,B001GQ3E4G,2.0,I didn't like the consistancy of this peanut butter. It could have been much creamier. And it wasn't sweet enough.
151847,B001EO5TRK,3.0,"We tried McCanns oatmeal about a year ago, ordering the variety pack. It was delicious and healthy. So I decided to order one of the favorite flavors, Maple & Brown Sugar. It was still delicious and healthy, but I don't remember having so many ""hulls"" in the oatmeal. I'm assuming these little hard bits are part of the outer layer of the oat, harmless but not really edible. My daughter won't eat it now because of it, so I'm stuck with too much oatmeal. At least it keeps well, but I'd hesitate to order again."
80836,B003DMXDGA,4.0,"Corn meal never tasted this good.<br /><br />These Smart Puffs are less salty, contain no dusty orange coloring and don't leave your hands and teeth looking like you ate a ball of fake orange cheese.  They melt in your mouth.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to a Cheetos addict to let them see what a more natural like product tastes like.<br /><br />These contain real dairy ingredients and whey, for those who are allergic to milk.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price.  At over thirty bucks a case these are quite expensive.  Grab these when they go on sale for under twenty bucks."
126360,B000I1QO5Q,1.0,"This hot chocolate is good if mixed with a small amount of steamed milk, or added to a shot of espresso.  I'm giving this one star for the price.  Why is this item over $30 for 8 T-Discs?  This is an outrageous price for one package of hot chocolate discs."
135136,B000EDI1O0,1.0,"I am from Ukraine, so I grew up on buckwheat, and I know how ""Kasha"" is supposed to taste and look like. This is not it. Once you cook it, this Kasha looks like goo, not like Russian Kasha is supposed to be - very flaky, with each piece of wheat separated. It tastes pretty bad too, like it got burnt or something. No matter how much butter or salt you put in, it still tastes bad. The only reason I bought this product because it was organic and I did not want to buy it on Russian website (was afraid of them stealing my credit card), but now I have to, because THIS is not good."
254641,B007PA32L2,2.0,MY DAUGHTER & I BOTH ENJOY PUMPKIN SPICE COFFEE.  SAW IT AT BED BATH & BEYOND.  PURCHASED A BOX FOR $12.89.  HAD IT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.  NO FLAVOR WHAT SO EVER.  I WON'T BE PURCHASING AGAIN.
163500,B001UJIFRU,3.0,I liked this combination of coconut water with Acai and Pomegrantate.  The only downside with my purchase was that no straws were included at all.  How can a boxed drink that you use to take along with you not come with straws?  Does VITA CoCo expect their consumers to drink this directly from the top of the box - very inconvenient.

255753,B0046GZQ76,2.0,you are sometimes surprised.  These have 530 mg of sodium per ounce of seeds. That is double to triple the sodium of most salted sunflower seeds. Hopefully I can give them away as I cannot eat them with that much salt.
251074,B002INDU22,2.0,"Cons: I ordered a box and tried it with vinegar to reduce my blood sugar. This product did not affect the taste of the vinegar. The tablets taste like cardboard and took forever to melt/dissolve on my tongue. I will try again and if it works better I will update this review. As of now, the product did not work as advertized.<br /><br />Pros: The product was shipped super fast and arrived on time."
135214,B002910N6Y,1.0,"I tried the chocolate peanut butter and the strawberry. Neither was appealing, at all. The chocolate PB was the worst, and I didn't even consider it edible. The strawberry was not quite as bad, but it had the overwhelming flavor of the whey protein. It was obvious to me that both were water-based, and the flavors are very artificial tasting.<br /><br />Ordinarily I'm ok with low-calorie foods, but Artic Zero just did not taste good to me at all."
132686,B0034L8UNG,1.0,I received them only to find out that they were stale and old.  I have purchased them individually at GNC so I am familiar with how they should taste and feel and these could hardly be bitten into.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!
154724,B0017U08M2,3.0,"I could eat this Vegan Split Pea Soup and be fairly well satisfied. It's tasty enough and easy to prepare. Of course it doesn't come close to my homemade pea soup but when there's no time to cook up a batch of the regular soup, then this is nice to keep on hand. It has a good texture and is filling."

126690,B003IHO8LY,1.0,I bought a 12 pack of the Neuro Sleep based on reading reviews of the product.  Silly me...should have walked away.  This products has a pleasant taste but doesn't do diddly squat for helping me get to sleep.  This was an utter and complete waste of 30 some dollars for the 12 pack.
77115,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is about as tasty as granola gets.  It makes excellent snack food and tastes very good - especially the chocolate chunks with are high quality and very good.  Made with all natural ingredients, it is healthy - as healthy as natural granola can be, given the high calorie and fat contents of the natural ingredients.  The only downside to this granola product is the lack of large clusters - something that can only be created with artificial additives.  While large clusters may not be organic, they sure make eating granola much easier and more enjoyable.  In a bag like this, all of the granola comes in small, individual grains, so you really need to use a spoon if you don't want to get it all over the place - large, clumsy man fingers don't do so well with this product."
123627,B003DA54HS,1.0,"I have a couple of dogs, one of which, loves to chew on bones. I gave it to my dog as a Christmas treat and it went to town. But later I found little splinters on the floor. It did not register to me at first since it had lost the meat flavoring color and it was pure white. Still being oblivious at the time, I tried to give the same dog another one, seeing how he loved the first one, and he just walked the other way. Then after my dog threw up, the bone splinter riddle was solved.<br />Later, my daughter, who works at a dog adoption organization, told me that I should have never given my dog pork bones... at least not the dried out variety. Perhaps this won't be a problem for your dog but my dog can really chew thru bone... so maybe that was it. In any case, lesson learned for me with my dogs. And perhaps a heads up for you and your dog if you have any concerns."
75723,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"Energy drinks are pretty common these days and tend to contain the same main ingredients (sugar, caffine, taurine) so it really comes down to how they taste and do they give you a kick.  On the taste side this one has a kind of light fruity taste that I found pretty refreshing.  It did not taste very ""energy drinky"".  On the kick side I really didn't notice much, certainly no more that the average Red Bull or Monster - but your mileage may vary.  I'd recommend trying it for the taste and you may end up liking it."
77587,B001LG940E,4.0,"I got on can of this through the amazon vine program.<br /><br />I love black cherry soda.  Some of my favorites are IBC's black cherry and Henry Weinhard's black cherry vanilla soda.<br /><br />This soda was very good but different from any of the other types I've had before.  It is not super sweet.  If you have had IBC'S black cherry or Henry Weinhard's black cherry; both of these have a strong vanilla overtone and are deliciously sweet.  The Switch wasn't as sweet as these varieties and had a more pure cherry flavor to it.<br /><br />I also drink a lot of Izze sparkling juices (although they do not have a cherry flavor).  The Izze juices are much more carbonated and tend to have fruit flavors that are less true to the fruit (mainly because I think pear juice is added to sweeten a lot of them, not sure if this is true for all flavors).<br /><br />So to sum up the Switch soda is:<br />- Less carbonated than IZZE; more carbonated than IBC<br />- Truer fruit taste than IZZE sodas.<br />- Less sweet than IBC or Henry Weinhard<br />- No vanilla overtones, just pure cherry flavor.<br /><br />I personally like the IBC cherry soda better; but it is definitely not as good for you, with more artificial colors and sugar added.  I liked the Switch better than the IZZE sodas because I am not big on carbonation and I liked the pure cherry taste.  I am not sure if I will ever buy a case of this stuff but it was pretty good."
167443,B007PE7ANY,3.0,"If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars. Edible, tasty, nothing new and different. I wouldn't buy it and I'm certainly not craving for another one."
126358,B000I1QO5Q,1.0,"The chocolate syrup taste of this one is off the mark!  Surprising, because their coffees and teas are so good!  I buy this because it's cheaper than buying another brand of coffee maker.  But then again, is it?"

238352,B0057JF92S,2.0,"Quinn popcorn has the right idea.  Straight popcorn in a biodegradable bag with no chemicals, additives etc.  After popping the corn, flavor is added by adding oil and a flavor and shaking the bag.  It should be heavenly.  But in fact the parmesan had the consistency of flour and just coated my mouth.  And I shook that bag a lot.  I would recommend mixing everything in a bowl instead of the bag; that might help.  The idea is terrific.  However I think better results could be obtained by popping plain corn in a brown paper bag and adding fresh grated parmesan and a bit of oil.  Perhaps the other two flavors would be better but I just tried parmesan and rosemary.  It was disappointing and I so wanted to love it."

135550,B001EO7FMC,1.0,"First, let me say that my husband likes this just fine.  I think it's awful.  We bought it for a recipe.  The aroma of cheap pine incense overwhelms the tea aroma when you open the can, and the same is true of the made tea.  One word:  yuck.  I do not want to use it in the recipe.  I'm sure it would overwhelm all of the other flavors."

252536,B000RZNY5G,2.0,"The Kirkland Signature pistachios are US #1 Grade, fresh, and are price competitively.  One problem is that it contains too much salt.  The salt content is 7% of daily value per serving (30g without shells), which prohibits me from eating too much each time."

136429,B006Q820X0,1.0,"While the flavor of this coffee is acceptable, mechanically it just does not work in the Keurig brewer.  I don't know if the problem is the size of the grind or some problem with the K-cup containers themselves, but almost every cup I have tried to make has been virtually unuseable.<br /><br />The water barely drips from the K-cup while brewing instead of producing a steady stream as other containers do. On at least two occasions the back-pressure was so high as to cause my brewer to overflow out of the top of the K-cup container because the brew could not be pushed through the K-cup as it should be.  Both holes were punched in the K-cup correctly and the holes in the needles are NOT obstructed.  I can remove the Brooklyn K-cup and insert any other one I have and it will flow correctly.  I have two brewers and the problem is the same in both brewers.<br /><br />In addition to the over-flow and back-pressure problems, every cup I have brewed has also contained a significant portion of coffee grounds in the cup, several cups have been so full of grounds as to be undrinkable.  This leads me to believe that at least part of the problem is the size of the grind.<br /><br />I've used almost half the box trying to get things to work to no avail, but I don't feel I can request a refund after using that much of the product.  I have no interest in replacement product as the flavor is not that special and I don't trust it to work any better.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience recommend this coffee to anyone."
77127,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is indeed a delicious combination of oats and dark chocolate, both of which are believed to have health benefits.  In addition to the chocolate clusters, which are sweetened with sugar (and also contain milk, if that is of significance to you) there are added sweeteners--evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, and molasses--and also safflower oil.  So, while there are no artificial ingredients, the natural ingredients in this granola are those which should be consumed in moderation.  This is not a daily breakfast cereal."

It's got a little spice in a creamy base but it just doesn't seem to mesh together well.  Maybe because it's refridgerated and if it's going to be creamy and spicy I'd prefer to have it warm.  It just does not seem to work well and I can't figure out what food this sauce would taste best with.  The label says to use it on Taco Salads and tacos and things like that.  And you could use it on fries.... but I am not sure that it would taste all that great considering there are so many other options.  I would urge you to try one of the other two new Taco Bell sauce flavors first, the Spicy Ranchero or the Chipotle.  Both of those were much better in my opinion.<br /><br />The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle. You have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top. Sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings."

They just recently changed the formula to include a bunch of new items and my dogs can no longer eat it.  Two of the four of them immediately developed a lot of gas and then started to itch within days of giving them the new bag of food.  One literally tore her neck to shreds scratching and we now have a vet bill.  I'm sorry to say we will no longer be using this product!

He figured out there were sometimes pills in hot dog pieces (something to try nonetheless) so he began carefully checking each piece and spitting out the pills. So I tried Pill Pockets. The first one worked, and that was the last time. He won't even taste them now. So for me, Pill Pockets were expensive and ineffective. I now cook him up some chicken hearts and conceal the pills inside every day as needed while he isn't looking, then trim them down to barely cover the pill. I get him excited by quickly feeding him the trimmings, followed up by the main piece with the pill inside. On occasion he still finds them, but he likes chicken so much that it works quite well, so far, anyway.<br /><br />Obviously Pill Pockets work very good for most people, but not for me and my dog."

And when that store stopped carrying it, I bought it here on Amazon, or so I thought.<br /><br />Turns out that only half of the boxes actually contained Sweet Ginger Peach Tea. Inside of each box is a sealed bag.<br />Last night I opened a box of tea, and opened the bag, made a cup of tea, and promptly spit it out.<br />It wasn't Sweet Ginger Peach tea at all. I couldn't figure it out. I pulled the bag out of the box to find out my box had been filled with a bag of Earl Grey Lavendar tea. Gross.<br /><br />I promptly opened another box to find the same thing. Out of the case of tea, half of it was Earl Grey Lavendar.<br /><br />If this case had been the Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, I would rate it five stars and tell everyone how lovely and soothing it is. But since the order was filled with boxes whose contents had been switched with something completely different, all I can do is say, save your money and your time and order elsewhere.<br /><br />EDIT!! After reading my complaint, Amazon refunded the full cost of the tea to my charge card. Their e-mail stated that they are going to investigate the issue with the packaging. I did not expect such a quick response. Hopefully they will get the issues straightened out and I can once again order this lovely tea!! Love AMAZON"

18072,B008ZRKZSM,5.0,"Dont go into this thinking after you mix up your peanut butter that it will taste like what you are familiar with. It wont. This isnt laden with the sugars and oils that give most store brand peanut butters the flavor people are familiar with. In fact, most of the oil from the peanut is pressed out of this as well. This is just straight up peanut butter without any frills (well, it is after you mix water into it anyway). Personally, I like it, and besides, there is plenty sugar in jelly anyway if you are gonna eat a PB&J using this, which I do from time to time. For me, it's primary use is in smoothies though. This powder is perfect for that. It blends thoroughly and you dont get all that aforementioned sugar and oil (and usually transfats) that comes with using most normal peanut butters, which basically means you arent adding junk to your diet. I would recommend however that if you planning to use this exclusively for sandwiches and are concerned about the lack of sweetness, that you try a brand like Justin's instead. For me though, this is pretty much perfect.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

They also have lots of sweetners included (in order): corn syrup, sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, brown sugar (in granola), fructose to add up to 12g per bar.

16485,B000E8Y5CM,5.0,"I normally drink loose leaf tea.  However, the Revolution tea bags are amazing!<br /><br />1. They don't fill the bag with dust and fannings. There really are recognizably sized leaves in this bag.<br /><br />2. You can tell that the leaves are decent sized because the almost-clear nylon bag gives you a great view into them.<br /><br />3. They leave plenty of room for the leaves to expand in the bag. It's about 1/3 full, and when you steep the leaves, you can see that they expand and flatten out nicely.<br /><br />Of the two types of Revolution tea I've tried, White Tangerine Tea and Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, the Sweet Ginger Peach is my favorite.  However, I tend to like fruity herbal teas more than straight black / white / green teas.  I like to hand people a bag of the Sweet Ginger Peach and have them take a good whiff. Granted, a lot of teas are simply aromatic, but this tea isn't. It really does have the fruity taste of ginger and peach. I love it.<br /><br />Also, the Sweet Ginger Peach tea makes excellent iced tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product."
81175,B000HDL19E,4.0,"These salted Season kipper snacks are almost as good as the non-salted, but not as good. There's no saltiness that gets in the way of the herring flavor, but somehow the full herring flavor doesn't come through the way it does with the non-salted version. Of course, if you prefer salted herring, this would be the best for you, although the salt certainly does not dominate. For me, I hardly notice it. That may be good or bad for you. But ordering this by the case from Amazon costs less and is more convenient than buying it at the grocery store if you use a lot of it--and with all of the omega 3's in this, you should use it a lot.

125586,B000P3T4HW,1.0,"LOOKING TO GAIN WEIGHT? I wasn't. My favorite smoothie to order is the PB and Strawberry, but they use this product. After 2 smoothies 2x week for two weeks, that's what 4 cups total. My weight has gone up! I'm a size 4, 5'6, 119 lbs. I'm a fitness, health freak, so when my weight goes up, something is wrong! What is it, then? SOY. Anytime I have eaten soy, my tush, thighs, and hips grow rapidly. Soy is a phytoestrogen, a plant estrogen. Women, like me, will put on pounds (around the ovaries: hips, thighs, tush) when consumed. Clifbars are a no no for me, too. This 'magic' low-cal low-fat 'peanut butter' is half soy! I am taking my organic PB to the smoothie shop, so I can have the real deal. The fat in the peanut is good unsaturated fats, why would you want less? Also, a tip. If you would like to feel great, and lose weight fast, try eating according to blood type! I went from 132 to 119 in two weeks! Google it!<br /><br />Ciao!"
77717,B001LG940E,4.0,"This is my 3rd Switch review, after trying the Watermelon Strawberry and the Kiwi Berry.  I'm a fan of all of them.  The Black Cherry is the one that tastes most like other ""normal"" sodas, so if you're looking for a taste you recognize, this is it.  The taste is definitely more cherryish than some of the artificial flavored sodas you'll find in supermarkets.  On the whole, it's definitely tasty.<br /><br />As with all the Switch beverages, I find the carbonation to be very pleasant: small bubbles that don't lead to an unpleasant feeling of ""gassiness.""<br /><br />I'm sure a bunch of other reviews have pointed out that the description of ""just juice and bubbles"" isn't quite correct: it's juice, bubbles, and a whole lot of natural sweeteners.  I'm not ready to have this replace water, milk, or juicy juice on the list of things I'd rather my (future) children drink...  but if it's a choice between this and soda?  This is definitely the lesser evil.  It's nice to have as an alternative."

Now, I have a gift for someone who would LOVE to have a bonzai, but who lives in an apartment so cannot keep it outdoors. I'm incredibly disappointed. The problem is not with the quality of the tree, which is wonderful. The problem is with Amazon's description, which has left me in the lurch just a few days before I had to give it as a gift."

It was poorly stored, so the chocolate is brittle and the cocoa butter has risen to the surface, so it's no good for nibbling, but when you melt it, i.e. for baking, it is much better. All low notes (no fruit or floral notes) makes for a chocolate that you should not use by itself in baking, it just doesn't have enough complexity.

79897,B0093A5TQS,4.0,"Peanut Matcha.  I was a little hesitant.  I don't know what it is about the idea of peanut flavoring in a tea ... it just doesn't sound right to me.  I am all for just about any other type of nut (yeah, I know that peanuts aren't technically nuts), but, peanuts just sounded too weird to me.  Then I tried Peanut Taffy and this changed my whole idea of how good peanut flavor can taste.<br /><br />So, I got the courage and I ordered this Matcha, and I'm pleasantly surprised.  It's really quite good.  Much better than I expected it to be.  It is good prepared traditionally, with water and whisked well, but then after taking my first sip, I decided I wanted to find out what a pinch of salt might add to the flavor.  And so I added a tiny pinch of sea salt and I LOVE this.  It is really yummy!<br /><br />Smooth, rich and creamy.  Nice peanut flavor, balanced well with the fresh, leafy green taste of the Matcha.  Really tasty - much tastier than I expected!"

125129,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"This used to be about the greatest thing you could buy for less than $50. Really. What other product could you purchase and credibly say, ""this is the best in the world""? Lindt 70 actually became difficult to find at the grocery stores I go to because the secret was clearly out. Now there's plenty, so Lindt screwed up the bottom line as well as on purist grounds. And for those of us with soy allergies, the change is of course a disaster, as it's practically impossible to locate chocolate or any other dessert without some form of soy. I'll spare the reader a review of the new recipe. Why bother? It tastes like every other mediocre or worse dark bar out there: waxy, non-descript, and let's face it, a little too ""American,"" like American cheese is ""American.""<br />What should we do? A great gourmet store in Ellsworth, Maine (Rooster Brother)has the right idea. I hear the owner took one bite of the new recipe and sent the entire shipment back to Lindt. Perhaps other suppliers will take up the cause. Meanwhile, here's hoping that somebody at Lindt actually cares enough about quality and distinction to put the good old stuff back into production.<br />P.S. Amazon should change the image associated w/this to reflect the New Recipe packaging, lest people think we're dissing the old stuff."

248259,B0002ASNAW,2.0,"I have a 35-pound 6-month old Keeshond, who I would classify as a ""moderate"" chewer. I bought her this bone because she enjoys chewing things with a little bit of ""give,"" and the Durachew Nylabones seemed to be too hard to hold her interest for extended periods. Indeed, after some insecurity about this bone, my Keeshond took to it just fine. She seemed to enjoy lying on the floor, munching away on it for several minutes at a time. After the first session, I saw that her favorite chewing end had begun to fray, but the instructions stated that such fraying is normal and that the surface of the bone is designed to fragment into small pieces the size of a grain of rice, which are miniscule enough to pass through the dog's digestive tract without creating any dangerous or life-threatening obstructions.<br /><br />However, after only a couple more chewing sessions, I noticed that her favorite chewing end was wearing down to the point that nearly an entire nub was gone. Luckily for both of us, I never left her unattended while she was chewing on this bone. Earlier today, during one of her play sessions with the bone, I looked down and saw the bone lying on the floor, with my dog standing above it chewing on and trying to swallow something. The thing she was chewing on fell out of her mouth and I quickly swooped in to pick it up: It was a piece of the bone, substantially larger than a ""grain of rice""--about an inch long by half an inch wide. Though I cannot say for sure that a piece of such size could cause a bowel obstruction, I did not want to take any chances. The packaging advises the dog owner to throw the bone away as soon as large pieces begin to break off, and I did just that.<br /><br />Look. My dog is not a Pit Bull. She is a Keeshond. Keeshonden are not known for being aggressive chewers. And, although I will concede that my dog definitely enjoys chewing on things, she is not more of a chewer than an average dog, and there is no world in which she can be considered a ""powerful"" chewer. This bone only lasted for a week of occasional chewing? It should have stood up to more punishment. I only gave it a second star because my dog genuinely seemed to like chewing on it. Otherwise, I consider this bone a safety hazard.<br /><br />If you do choose to buy this bone, make sure you always supervise your dog when he is chewing it so that you can stop him if he starts to break larger pieces off. The instructions probably only give this warning for the purpose of waiving the company's liability, but they are right."
77528,B002EYBB3A,4.0,"This is AWESOME Tuna! Since I am a localvore, I spent much time searching and learning for a canned tuna that I felt safe eating. I do believe Wild Planet is a company to trust.

Even my most staunch ""I hate healthy food"" critic, my teenaged son admitted he liked it.  My only complaint would be the price which I think is too high and when you add shipping it becomes a luxury item.

Its kind of disappointing how little mint there actually is compared to other tea flavors. Its not a big deal, but if you are buying this product for the mint taste or that Halls mentholyptus feeling when you breathe in the hot vapors, you will be slightly disappointed. Thats what I was looking for. I also tried Bigelow brand green tea variety pack. Much better tastes, and their mint has a bit more mint in it.

I was looking for a smoother blend to add a little variety, but this almost boarders on bland. There are hints of a great flavor there, but no matter the grind, amount used or method of making a cup it never tastes better than okay. There is a bit of floral flavor as advertised, but it is not pronounced enough to make this a unique experience."

76818,B0015Z3BT6,4.0,"Bought this for our 15-yr old cat w/ mild chronic renal failure and poor appetite.  It does the trick.  It gets more liquid into her.  The reason we stopped buying this is b/c our kitty likes KMR kitten milk better, and that has a lot more fat than CatSure.  Since our kitty needs to gain weight, it's a better product for us.  If your senior cat is already fat, then don't use KMR--stick to CatSure.  Also, your cat may or may not drink CatSure.  Of our 4 cats, 1 is CRAZY for it, 1 thinks it's just OK, and 2 won't touch it.  So, probably a 50:50 chance your cat will drink this?  FYI, it helps to pour this into ice cube trays and melt 1 or 2 cubes at a time.  Otherwise, your cat may not be able to drink the whole can in the 3 days or so it's still good.  It's too spendy to waste.  Overall, CatSure is pretty good, and may benefit your cat.  Good luck!"

153464,B000ILEITA,3.0,My golden is a finicky eater and didn't really care for the treats.  He seems to like the soft treats better than the hard ones.  And when he does eat one of the treats it ends up in little pieces on the floor.
78790,B0031UBVX6,4.0,"We bought these when they were on a lightening deal to let our 3-yr old toddler try them. He definitely liked them a lot, and would ask for a ""cold smoothie"" almost every afternoon.

75742,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I liked the taste of the No Fear energy drink.  I didn't experience any kind of after-taste.  As for any kind of ""energy"" boost...I don't know.  If I felt any kind of energy boost, it was slight.  But, to be honest and fair, I've tried other brands of energy drinks and I can't say I ever feel any kind of boost.<br />All-in-all, this is a delicious drink and ranks right up there with any of the other drinks on the market."

126417,B001PO7FDU,1.0,"Yes I realize that many truffle oils are just an exercise in organic chemistry. However, if you want a strong truffle flavor and use a lot of this oil, then you will have a dish that smells like machine oil and still lacks a dense truffle taste.<br /><br />Looking at the oil from the top of a full can, you will notice small dark oil droplets suspended in an ocean of safflower oil. There's not many dark drops, which is the active ingredient. So you are really buying an expensive bottle of safflower oil. And when was the last time you remember eating truffles which looked like motor oil looking drops in your dish? There is a reason it comes in a dark metal can. Enough said, try another brand.<br /><br />Bottom line = yuck"

Antep pistachios are great, but when you take away the salt, they're just not as addictive.  I'm still going to eat them, I just won't horde them all to myself like I used to.  From now on, make sure you order your turkish pistachios with salt.  It makes all the difference in the world."

Switch used to come in bottles, but the cans are much more convenient and easy to recycle. The Kiwi Berry flavor is my favorite flavor, but all of the flavors are very tasty."
164384,B004B9JIYU,3.0,"Very cute. Mine is a little tilted, he leans to one side--the legs weren't assembled straight, but it's still functional. The only thing I don't like is that the dispenser gives about 15 m&ms at once and you have to make sure to catch them when you use the lever in the back--they just fly out because it's such a large opening. The good thing is that I should be able to refill with peanut m&ms (they came with regular)."
246507,B002D4DY8G,2.0,"I have purchased Gevalia flavored coffees for years, so I was looking forward to trying this Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Coffee.<br /><br />Chocolate is my favorite food, period, and I love chocolate truffles.  I am also a big coffee drinker.<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I took a few sniffs, but could detect no chocolate scent at all.<br /><br />I like my coffee on the milder side, so I put one slightly heaping scoop of coffee for a large coffee mug into my automatic coffeemaker.<br /><br />All I tasted was a bitter taste.  Now I know dark chocolate tends to be somewhat bitter, especially compared to other kinds of chocolate.<br /><br />On the front of the box of coffee it does say it's artificially flavored.<br /><br />For a more high end company I expected better.  Even tho the package was sealed, even when I first opened the package, it did not smell really fresh like it should have.<br /><br />To me, the only things that really ring true about this coffee is indeed it is coffee, and it is somewhat dark, especially compared to regular coffee.  I tasted no chocolate taste at all."

126301,B000F8GWRM,1.0,"I tried this stuff and I don't recommend it at all. I ate three or four pieces and a few hours later it started. The gurgling, the gas then the flow of diarrhea. It lasted a few days and before it subsided, I ended up in the ER with an IV and abdominal pain so bad I couldn't sleep. I received an ultrasound and a CT scan to see what was going on. A month later, I'm still dealing with pain and looking at more intrusive tests to figure out exactly what this stuff did to me.<br />IMO, candy should not need a warning label that includes the risk of hospitalization.<br /><br />Please stay away from anything containing the Maltitol and Sorbitol sugar substitutes."
249248,B004TPKAN4,2.0,"Never thought I'd see the day when a healthy brand touted real ""organic sugar"" as one of the main ingredients, or that I'd be thrilled to see it. There may be a few things that taste the same with high fructose corn syrup instead of good 'ol cane, but I have yet to find them. If I'm going to go all decadent and eat goodies, I want them to taste - well - good.<br /><br />I really like ginger snaps, they're a great comfort food and one of the few treats that have enough flavor that a handful is enough. I was looking forward to something a little more wholesome than my regular brand (you know the ones - look like cardboard, and probably as healthy) without going all organic-crazy and losing the flavor.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the package, most of the cookies were burnt on the underside, and about as hard as rocks. Well, they are ginger SNAPS, so I guess hard isn't bad, and they are easy enough to bite into, as long as your teeth are good. The flavor is definitely more ginger-y than the regular national brand, with tiny little bits of chewy ginger interspersed (bits have a consistency like chopped-up gummy bears). These little chewy pieces have some very strong ginger flavor, which is good if you love ginger.<br /><br />I think I'd really like these if they weren't burnt, but this batch has a singed flavor that just isn't very appealing. I might be willing to try them again, but I'm really wondering about their quality control if they could have this many bags leave the warehouse in this condition."

16595,B001LGGH40,5.0,the perfect mixer for a summer vodka concoction or by itself for a sweet pick-me-up treat.  The sweetness isn't overpowering and the flavor it true to itself.  Perfect size for my kids to pick one up and have a sweet soda!
157131,B002TMV3GC,3.0,"I drink a lot of coffee each day and I drink it black with just a bit of sugar.  I prefer to drink organically grown coffee but I made an exception for this one.  My first impression was the packaging - it's terrible and I ended up having to open it using a pair of scissors.  After brewing several pots of it I have to say I'm not that impressed with it.  It's smooth enough, with no bitterness but the overall flavor is weak and bland.  It's not a bad coffee but it's by no means the best coffee I've ever had and once this bag is used up I wouldn't buy any to replace it."
77089,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"The granola itself is fairly unsweet but the abundant semi-sweet chocolate chunks provide an overall appropriate sweetness and a chocolate flavor that is not overpowering.  I'm not into chocolate cereal, so I didn't try it with milk, but it quickly disappeared as a snack when left on the counter (I didn't even get to finish it)."
80489,B000I0CLK4,4.0,"These are great treats that I wish Amazon.com carried as part of its regular stock. These are essentially wax bottles of flavored sweets in them that vanish quickly when you're doing mindless work. Just bite off bits and chew them until the liquid is gone, then spit out the wax. They taste great and nice treats for kids as well. Summer candy they ain't, and the wax can melt unless shipped with an ice pack. The downside is the shipping price."
256509,B003JA5KBW,2.0,"I love pomegranate flavor and love all things fizzy, so I was excited to try this new energy boost supplement. The powder dissolved rather easily in water though it left a bit of a chalky pink color to the water.  The smell was very fruity and promising.  However my first taste was disappointing...the fizziness is underwhelming...much more ""alka seltzer"" type fizzy than sparkling water.  Also the taste is neither fruity nor would I saw it is really a pomegranate taste. Also left a bit of an odd after taste - it was not completely unpleasant but not a great taste either.<br /><br />I didn't feel really noticeable changes in energy level, as advertised. Also a bit pricey at ~$1.30 - ~1.40 per pack which yields an 8 oz serving.<br /><br />Although the product boost a number of beneficial vitamins and supplements and a relatively modest 20 calories, I will stick to supplements with a more powerful and much more pleasant taste."
76897,B0045TVL6E,4.0,"These buffalo jerky bites taste great, but they are expensive, especially when you consider the cranberries (which add a nice flavor, but are at the end of the day filler). If price isn't a concern, then there's no real negative for this product.<br /><br />This jerky is also a great option for those who on a gluten free diet. It's difficult to find gluten free jerky because many products include soy sauce and other unfriendly flavorings. This product doesn't contain any wheat or ingredients that contain wheat."
128632,B0001XIZMQ,1.0,I bought this rice (for $9.98)expecting to receive 10 5oz bags for the price.  The same thing in most stores cost $1.50 max.<br /><br />Luckily Amazon gave me a full refund (even though you are not allowed to return food).<br /><br />I would not buy this product via Amazon again. I'll just get it from my local story for 1/8 the price. a couple weeks after I bought this product the company lowered the price by 50%! Ha!

16467,B000FF5T9W,5.0,Dare cookies are made in a peanut & tree nut free factory in Canada.  They are super yummy and impossible to find in Texas. I hope that Amazon continues to carry them. Dare  Maple cookies are very good too.
248216,B0056GKZ30,2.0,"The nutrition in this cereal is undoubtedly good but the taste is pretty non existent.  It might have been ok when fresh but after being packaged in a plastic pouch it was a mushy mess that was almost inedible.  And expensive.  Do yourself a favor, save your money and cook some quinoa at home if you want this type of cereal."
132661,B002EM2JCY,1.0,"I know when I requested these water bottles, I specifically selected the option for GLASS. Instead I received plastic PET bottle from which Amazon themselves did not want to have returned because of their safety precautions; nevertheless this is what I was expected to drink out of. I am not an advocate of ingesting crude oil. Though my money was returned to me promptly."
17610,B000CMIYWC,5.0,This tea works just as it should.  Taste is a bit strong but a little honey goes a long way.  I use this to help with chest congestion due to allergies and use to use it when I had asthma for bad days.  You'll need 2-3 cups a day when your chest is very tight.  Otherwise 1 to 2 works great.  This is also a great buy as they tend to be $6.00 a box in the store.
16476,B000F9XBDE,5.0,"These are absolutely delicious. They have a bold flavor, which is, as another reviewer put it, quite addictive. Delicious on their own or with a delicate cheese, they take front and center on your taste buds."

Causes nonstop farting like you were born in New Jersey?  HELL YEAH.<br /><br />What can I add to this?<br /><br />Well, a few months back my coworkers and I drew up a contract for a spirited competition.  The contestants were to eat three bars back to back with plenty of fluid at breakfast.  The winner would be determined by the last person to use the bathroom.  Unfortunately during a test run where I consumed three bars in one sitting, I discovered that even tapping out and running at a full sprint to the bathroom was too much of a risk - especially at work!  Thank GOD I was wearing  my Ex Officio Give-N-Go Briefs!  That at least contained the rush that I experienced.<br /><br />We devised a different sport to compete in.  Eat one bar and then 30 minutes later go to the gym and use the elliptical machine.  You win in one of two ways:  1.  Hold out and do not pass gas at all during a 20 minute workout. However you can also win by passing enough gas to drive your competitors off of their machines.  So even if you tap out early you can still win.<br /><br />It is critical to use the elliptical during this challenge due to the rapid cheek movement it causes.<br /><br />I gotta stop eating these things.  No one wants to sit near me anymore."

Anyone who buys this brand of cat food knows that it is pricey, and $[...] is a very good price for a case of 6oz cans, and a very high price for a case of 3oz cans.

164313,B002915VF2,3.0,"I've tried all the Artic Zero flavors, and the Chocolate is my favorite! I can eat it a whole pint at a time. The chocolate Peanut Butter is ""OK"", but I wish they could make it actually have a peanut butter taste. I couldn't tell there was really any peanut butter flavor at all. The Vanilla and Strawberry Banana I can't even eat on their own. I've used them in a smoothie to save ice cream calories, but don't think they are worth the extra expense. So, I've stopped buying anything but the Chocolate flavor, which I re-order every few months. I've also tried the Pumpkin Spice flavor, that one bombed too. I just ordered their Chocolate Mint Cookie flavor and can't wait to give it a try! I have high hopes for that one! But if your on the fence of what to buy, try their Chocolate and Chocolate Peanut Butter combo and decided which you like better from there.<br />3 stars, because it doesn't have the ""real"" ice cream texture you would expect, but for the calories it helps me get my ice cream fix!  And the Chocolate flavor is better.<br /><br />P.S. sometimes there are occasional problems with some of the pints arriving a little soft and melted. After sticking them in the frezzer to re-freeze, when you go to eat them they can have an icy texture. This is unfortunate, because of how expensive they are. I don't want a single bit to go to waste! But since I can't find them locally, I have been willing to just deal with it."
234324,B0029JU0ZU,2.0,"Besides the obvious flavor difference these are nothing like Strawberry Twizzlers in texture or taste.  The texture instead is super soft, almost jelly or gummi bear consistency without the chew.  The disappointing multiple flavors are strongly artificial, almost perfume like.  Could not finish the opened bag and threw away the other 5 unopened bags."
167004,B000EMAMYS,3.0,"I bought this as a possible cure to my pregnancy morning sickness. It's definitely too strong for me! The ginger is obviously of good quality and the chunks are large, but I just couldn't eat it. (I bought the ginger chews of this same brand and those were great!)"

164630,B00106HOMK,3.0,"This is indeed an interesting product, but the large-print label does not tell the whole story. If the customer reads carefully, the contents are revealed: ""Camargue Red Rice is a delicious healthful rice that includes Extra Fancy 100% wild rice, and delicious blends of wild rice, brown rice, and basmati"". From this, it is not clear whether it contains Camargue Red Rice at all. Is this packaging statement simply inept while there actually is the desirable specialty red rice as would appear from the picture, or what? I for one would not want to spend this kind of money online just to find out.<br /><br />You will also note that the Amazon description includes the statement ""6-Grain medley combines three beautiful and delicious rices with hull less barley, rye berries and black and purple barley"" but after a bit of thought, I realized this refers to a different product and somehow was put here where it doesn't belong. That actually is what caught my attention because rye and barley contain gluten, which is off-limits for sufferers of gluten intolerance who often seek alternatives such as these interesting rices."

I am deducting a star because we were told by Amazon that we would get a pack of 12, but we only received one can. I didn't want to share. I really liked it and it didn't give me a headache.  I liked the aftertaste and my son, the know-it-all of energy drinks, said most had a juice in it.  Well, if I had known it was grapefruit, I probably would not have liked it simply because I have a bias against grapefruit.  But I tasted it first and I liked it. The Punk wants more!"

160861,B004H4QZCW,3.0,It's certainly not Skyline but in a pinch it's a close enough facsimile.  Since Amazon seems to have quit carrying 'real' Skyline and I can't justify paying the third party 12-15 dollar shipping charges I went with this product to satisfy my hometown chili cravings.  Makes a decent 4-way and much better than nothing at all.

I am trying to decide if I should keep the ones I already have or throw them away and get something I trust. The company claims they test for many dangerous chemicals and additives, but some enterprising criminal somewhere is bound to come up with something that nobody has thought to test for, imo. That's what I'm afraid of. *sigh*"
17147,B003VVL8NS,5.0,"I definitely remember buying Turkish Taffy in all four flavors (Vanilla, Bananna, Chocolate, and yes, Strawberry) for $0.05 at our local drugstore when I was a wee lad. I took a bit of a haitus because I became an adult (sort of), and because the Bonomos stopped making it. But I never forgot the wonderful flavors and consistency of the taffy; my favorite was the bananna.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I saw Turkish Taffy for sale at our local County Fair last week! It was for sale for $1.59 almost 32X more expensive than it was thirty five years ago. But the flavor is right on (bananna and vanilla), and the consistency is excellent. I was able to break it up into nice pieces at room temperature with a few well placed whacks! The secret is to hit it several times at different places along the length of the bar against a hard, rounded or ""blunt"" object, such as the edge of a curb or a stair railing. Don't smack it against a flat surface. I was willing to overlook the incredible inflated price (Note; its cheaper here on Amazon - $1/bar if you get a 24-count box) and I enjoyed several bars.<br /><br />The only thing spoiling a very nice effort by the folks currently distributing the product is that the wrapper is all wrong. Either they didn't bother to do their reserach, or more likley, they are hoping we will overlook what is probably a large cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. Today's product is wrapped in a plastic sleeve that has a seam running down the back and is sealed on both ends. As millions of people my age know, this kind of wrapper makes it very difficult to get at the chunks, particularly the small ones, that you have just created inside the covering.<br /><br />The old wrapper was foil with the color matching the flavor on the outside (yellow for bananna, etc.), and silver metallic color on the inside. The metallic wrapper could be gently unfolded first on the ends, and then along the middle to expose 100% of the marvelous, freshly broken taffy...and then folded back up and stuffed into your pocket!! Very important for those quick getaways on your bike. (That might have had a bananna seat...)<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF STARS AWARDED:<br />**** for the effort to reintroduce Turkish Taffy + * for nice flavor - * for lousy wrapper + * for outstanding breakability = ***** Basically, the product quality trumps the lousy wrapper in my opinion, although I discovered its not a good idea to stuff a half-eaten bar wrapped in cheap plastic into your suitcoat pocket. So if you're listening Bonomo People, please bring back the foil wrapper. With the 20X price increase (based on Amazon's price for a box), there's got to be a little profit margin in there for the original, authentic foil. Really."

Not a great Keemun (my daily drink), but okay for my morning thermos on the ride in to work.  It came in a plastic coated paper bag with a zip top.  I ran out and decided to order some more.  The second batch (unfortunately I ordered 3...big mistake) came in plastic lined paper roll-down bags like shown in the image.  And it is junk.  I can't even drink it.  It has no flavor.  Forget the fact that there is almost none of the signature Keemun flavor.  There is almost no flavor at all!

Now we knew the only place that we could find them was Fry's Electronics, but we do not go out there all that often.  When we do go to Fry's you can bet your butt we stock up by taking most if not all of them off the shelves (21 bags last time).  Some people we know were in town from NH over Memorial Day weekend and we took them out to eat, in return they sent us a 5lb bag of gummie frogs!  You could imagine my surprise when I walked back to my desk from lunch and found a box from Amazon that was squishy.  I opened that puppy and was like OMG!!!  Yeah, the bf breezed through the 5lb bag in about a weeks time sharing them with co-workers (mostly consuming them himself) and with myself (i still have my little zip lock baggie in my camera bag :-) ).  I just ordered 2-5lb bags of these yummy frogs and hopefully they will last a lot longer then the first one :-)"

I appreciate that it is sweetened with natural ingredients & contains no artificial preservatives, flavors or color; it's made with whole oats & has no trans fat. This granola contains 4 gr. of fiber/serving which isn't bad, but at 220 calories, I'd like a bit more fiber.<br /><br />I love the dark chocolate in this mix. It definitely tastes real and not fake like the chocolate in some cereals. There's just the right amount of chocolate...not too much that the chocolate is over-powering, & not too little that you can't taste it. I like eating this for a snack. But, as others mentioned, there are some crunchy clusters along with part crumbly granola. I'll have to have a spoon ready for this snack.<br /><br />Instead of baking cookies for car trips, I mix up some of our favorite, healthy, high-fiber cereals,  add pretzels, nuts, dried orange flavored  cranberries, raisins, & candy coated chocolate pieces. It's good.  I was intending to use this as a snack for long car trips, too. I tested a chocolate piece in my hand & it melted...so guess that idea won't work.<br /><br />I like this granola with milk, too.<br /><br />It's definitely snack-worthy, even if I have to use a spoon."

I too bought this because it was listed as one of the best on the market, and both my cats were eating it but one of them nearly died because of this diet. After talking with others that had pets with bladder blockage problems, some indicate that the name ""Wellness"" in often association. I can't help but think that his ailment must have something to do with this food. While I can't say it was THE cause because my other cat didn't get sick, this certainly didn't prevent it and was most of his diet. I am switching to a wet or canned diet for my cat, and I am definitely not using this brand ever again. And I don't think you should risk it.<br /><br />Also, I hope others who have this experience will write reviews because a food that charges a premium for its purported high quality shouldn't have such terrible effects on any pets--even if it is just a marginal amount."

I tried Barry Farm's in accordance with the suggested usage but the result was disappointing.<br />The bread not only rose less than usual but the crust got severely burned - using standard machine setting.

Put in 3 cups of rice, add water to the line, and 45 minutes later it is done perfectly.  I think what I like best about this rice is the texture.  It has a lot of ""crunch"" left in it after cooking.  The Soft Wheat & Rye Berries add to that crunchy texture as does the wild rice.  And this rice has a lot more flavor than plain, white rice.  We also know that this whole grain product is much more healthy for you than the plain white variety.  I have occasionally found this rice in some of the stores where I shop but far too often I search for it in vain.  Thankfully, I can count on Amazon to have this in stock!!!<br /><br />I also like the Rice Select Royal Blend with Brown & Red Rice with Pearled Barley & Rye Berries.

164479,B0029JDU70,3.0,"I originally ordered erythritol directly from Emerald Forest and have fallen in love with it. For those familiar with xylitol, this is better in almost every way.<br /><br />It's nominally 70% as sweet as sugar. I find it slightly less sweet than xylitol, but my roommate finds it to be more sweet. It also has less of what I would describe as a ""bite"" to its sweetness than xylitol, especially in warm beverages.<br /><br />It doesn't have the upset tummy effect, since it doesn't seem to attack our symbiotic E. Coli. This does make it less interesting for anti-microbial applications, such as a nasal or oral/dental rinse. I still keep xylitol around for that.<br /><br />It works just fine in nearly all cooking. It even caramelizes. I haven't tried pushing my luck with yeast-leavened bread, however. My yeast still gets fed dextrose, with erythritol as a supplement for sweet doughs. If the yeast can't, in fact, metabolize the erythritol, this will make adjusting sweetness much easier when using a bread machine.<br /><br />Now the downsides. It does have about a fifth of a calorie per gram, which means a single packet is closer to 1 calorie than 0. It has much more of a ""cooling"" effect when dissolving even than xylitol. It's a bit time consuming to dissolve in iced tea, and I tend to need to ""zap"" my coffee in the microwave for a few seconds if it's not at just-brewed temperature.<br /><br />I've had one successful order from Amazon of this item and received the thousand-pack bulk box. My most recent order, however, turned out to be xylitol instead of erythritol. Fortunately, I'm not completely out of my first order yet. If actually getting the correct product is important, I'd say it's worth paying the extra money and ordering direct from Emerald Forest Sugar."

76066,B002EAQXQO,4.0,"Your satisfaction with this granola bar will likely be relative to your appreciation of tasty treats, tolerance for sugar and definition of a snack.  If you want a low sugar item, look elsewhere.  If you are merely looking for a quick and tasty snack (and you can confine yourself to one bar), this may be a great bar for you.<br /><br />Summary of likes:<br />1) Good taste<br />2) Portable and easy to pack<br />3) Good snack for those who cannot consume nuts<br /><br />Summary of dislikes:<br />1) There is not much that is nutritional value to this bar.  It has a high sugar content and low fiber.<br /><br />For more details on the above points, please read on.<br /><br />What I like about this bar:<br />1) The taste - Wow!  For a granola bar the taste is phenomenal.  If you are a vegetarian and cannot eat Rice Krispy treats because of gelatin, this is a very good substitute.  These bars have a light marshmallow type flavor and the chips add contrast to the granola.<br /><br />2) Portable and easy to pack - If you try to stay aware of your daily calorie intake, it is always great to have easy to carry snacks with their calories clearly labeled. Who has time to count out the exact number of pretzels that comprise 140 calories? That is part of the appeal of a granola bar. You've got a 140 calorie food item that can be placed in a purse or coat pocket and you are out the door.<br /><br />3) No nuts -- for those that cannot consume nuts, this bar is nut free.<br /><br />What is questionable about this bar:<br />1) This is a snack/treat bar and nothing else - This is not a healthful nutrition bar.  The product packaging does not necessarily say this is healthful.  It does use the word ""wholesome"" and boasts ""8 grams of whole grains"".  These notations along with the presence of granola may make some think this is a really healthy treat.  But it's not.  The bar has low fiber (1g) and very high sugar for a 140 calorie bar (13 grams).<br /><br />If you use snacks to hold you over, you probably should find a snack with at least 4 grams of fiber.  The 1 gram is not going to tide you over very long.<br /><br />If you feed these to your kids, there is a good likelihood they will like them.  They are pretty sweet and the vanilla chips are a nice touch.  But again with the sugar, what else are you giving your kids during the day?  Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar.  So you have about 3 and 1/4 teaspoons in this bar.  With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this bar may not be worth it to you.  Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day.  While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Cascadian Farms has created a very tasty, imitation Rice Krispy treat.  Props to the company for not saying this was a health or nutrition bar on the box.  I am reviewing this as a treat bar and as a treat, it is pretty tasty.  If it were being reviewed for health, I would not be able to give it four stars as it has high sugar and low fiber so it won't hold you over for hours until your next meal.<br /><br />These granola bars are made in the United States."

It's basically like drinking chocolate milk with added sugar.<br /><br />The marketing is based on the concept of the desirability of consuming a 3:1 carbs to protein ratio after working out.  In my opinion that is bad science.  Some doctors (the most public is Dr. Mercola) believe that if you consume (simple) carbs after working out then you have negated all the benefits of that workout.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Contains a good amount of cocoa (12g) (but they don't mention how that cocoa may have been processed)<br />* 525 mg of Potassium<br />* 5 grams fiber<br />* Sugar is used as a sweetener instead of artificial sweeteners<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Milk Protein Isolate - thus casein (and casein is well known to be unhealthy) - I would far rather see whey protein used (the healthy protein in milk) but that would have increased cost significantly.<br />* 25 grams of Sugar<br />* Cost - at the time of writing this review it is $2.83 per 11 oz - coconut water would be a *much* better choice at only about $2 per 11 oz.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by ""science"" which shows ""benefit"" by comparison with other unhealthy choices.<br /><br />And as a final point, it's so thick that it doesn't taste good to me.

148587,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a big fan of granola bars but I enjoyed the big nut taste and peanut butter flavor in the Planters Big Nut Bar. On a taste basis alone, I'd give this product a 4-star rating. The only negative I had is that after eating it I was left with a quite dry taste in my mouth and had to drink a lot of water to get rid of it. If I wasn't a person who is trying to carefully watch my intake of calories, fat and carbs I'd be looking to eat Planters Big Nut Bar on a regular basis when I wanted a good tasting, high protein snack. However, given that each 1.62 oz. bar contains 220 calories (110 from fat), 13 grams total fat and 22 grams of carbs, I'd only give a 2-star rating to the nutritional qualities of this product; thus, resulting in my overall rating of 3 stars. While I liked the taste of the Big Nut Bar, the product's amount of calories, fat and carbs will prevent me from being a buyer on anything more than a very occasional basis. However, if you are not carefully watching these nutritional factors and you want a good tasting, high protein snack bar, than I think you will find that the Big Nut Bar will satisfy your needs."

156755,B0026YDP8C,3.0,"I love coffee. My preference is to fresh grind premium beans myself just before brewing and make the coffee in my French press. Yum! But this process is a lot of trouble and I'm lazy (or as I prefer to put it, ""busy""). I've been tempted to get one of the Keurig systems. They make pretty decent coffee and they're easy. But I haven't yet gotten the nerve to spend the $100 for a basic machine. My wife uses a Nespresso machine which I don't like very much. For a long time my compromise was to use pre-ground premium coffee in a standard drip coffee machine. But even this is a little trouble -- have to wash the pot, throw away the used filters -- and the real problem is that I was drinking too much coffee.<br /><br />So I broke down and tried these Folgers single-serve packets. The coffee is okay, not great, but okay. A little better, I think, than coffee from Macdonald's. And it's REALLY EASY. Exactly like making a cup of tea with a tea bag -- same pros and cons. I'm on my third or fourth box now. And I'm usually drinking only two mugs a day, instead of the three or four I used to drink with the drip coffee maker.<br /><br />I have had one problem with the Folgers packets: In quite a few cases, the string gets caught at the top of the bag and when I ripped the bag open along the ""tear here"" line, I ended up ripping the bag itself and spoiling it. I've spoiled several bags this way. The solution I've discovered is to use a scissors to CUT the bag open, carefully. No problems when cutting. But I forget occasionally and I have continued to have this problem from time to time. Perhaps I'm just buying from a slightly defective lot that was delivered to my local grocery store.<br /><br />Which brings me to my final point. I'd love to buy from Amazon -- but the price is too high. That is rarely the case but seems to be the case here. If I understand this correctly, Amazon is selling two 38-packet boxes (total of 76 coffee packets) for $32. Well, I've been buying the 38-packet boxes from my local Albertson's grocery store (Dallas, Texas) for $10 each. And they aren't marked at the store as being on sale."

I'm sure, given the limitations of what you can put in a coffee pod, this isn't a horrible failure.  But let's call it what it is--watery hot chocolate that may have a detectable coffee flavor.

I bought this item in hopes that it could replace the plastic chew toys made by the same manufacturer, but unfortunately, it isn't tough enough. There is a small pamphlet inside the packaging that says this size is for dogs no bigger than 50#s.

133608,B0029J6KAY,1.0,I purchased this package of Milky Ways a few months ago and if I had written my review then I would have given it 4 stars. I paid $17.96 at the time. That came to $4.49 a bag and they are nice large bags. If it wasn't for the length of time it took to ship I would have given it 5 stars. Now it's more than doubled in price and comes to $9.00 a bag. I find that a ridiculous price and a very steep increase in such a short period of time. These bags are large but they are not that large. Do yourself a favor and buy them at Walmart or your grocery store.

249625,B001LGGH54,2.0,"Ok, here is my Vine Review of this product. It is only 8 ounces, so the can is small. I pictured it being the size of one of those Arizona Tea Drinks in the big can for .99 cents. Anyway, the can says Watermelon Strawberry, but when you read the side panel you will see that they add the usual Grape and Apple to water it down. The mixture is a little syrupie and does not really taste like natural Strawberry-Watermelon at all. The carbination is minimal, almost like it was a flat soda. Now to the good part! The little 8 oz can has a whopping 140 calories, 36 carbs and 35g of sugar. Not a good drink if you are a diabetic or are trying to lose weight. I was not impressed with the product at all."

I have found very good tapioca flour imported from Asian countries, usually packaged in white/green paper packets and available in the import sections of most large stores such as Overwaitea and Superstore. The cost is also less than 25% of that of BRM tapioca.<br /><br />However, BRM potato starch is excellent, and indispensable in gluten-free baking.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VLVCGU"">Bob's Red Mill Potato Starch, 24-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />As an alternative to this flour mix, I make the following excellent gluten/corn-free baking flour mix.

Instead, I ended up with a bland mushroom-like topping that does little other than look appealing.  The texture of the carpaccio is pleasing and there is some definite truffle aroma if you take a big whiff from the jar.  The packing oil seems pleasant enough as well.  Really, the only thing lacking is the main event.  Sadly, I cannot recommend this product at all.  I would recommend checking out some truffle salt instead."

As a fly attractant this product works as great as Bud Light beer.<br /><br />My dogs don't even care for it.

If our little one wakes up too early and has already nursed, he'll have a froose and go back to sleep. When he was sick, it was the only liquid other than nursing that I could get in him. I buy the pear flavor because it has less sugar than the others by froose. I like that it is more nourishing and substantial than other juices. It is thicker and ""syrupy"", but that's not a problem unless you have a box squeezer. That could be solved by placing the juice box in a small cup.

I was really disappointed, since other flavors of Stagg chili are surprisingly good. My favorite is the steakhouse chili which is generally available from Costco.

82236,B000M5XN1Q,4.0,"I'm a big spice mix fan and have to give a strong thumbs-up for Chef Tom's Bengal Masala Rub. Surprisingly, this is neither a 'burn your mouth hot' rub, nor is it even heavy on the cumin and curry flavors.  (Though why *wouldn't* you be surprised, given the exceedingly generic Product Description that Amazon lists for this mix!)<br /><br />There really isn't a single dominant note in this rub, it's a balance of cardamom, smoked paprika, garlic, and even (I suspect) cinnamon. I'd advise people who want to kick things up a notch to add a dash of cayenne or black pepper.<br /><br />This works very well on lamb, chicken, and (surprisingly!) fish such as catfish or snapper.  Tends to be lackluster on red meats and fish like tuna and salmon.<br /><br />Only the two standout mixes that Chef Tom sells: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are better than this one, mostly due to their extra versatility."
75863,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"As far as energy drinks go, this one has a flavor I enjoyed. Most energy drinks taste awful but this one has a nice flavor without the chemical, vitamin taste that some energy drinks have. I usually avoid energy drinks for this very reason but this one I would drink again.<br /><br />The drink also gave me a boost to get my day going. I was very tired the day I drank this and it helped me to get the day going. It kept me going for quite awhile until the early afternoon. I would say it did it's job!<br /><br />The two drawbacks to the energy drink are the price and also the amount of calories in the can. The can contains two servings but I don't know many people who drink half of a can. That brings the calories in the can to a total of 260, 130 if you drink half of a can or one serving. That is quite a bit if you count calories. The price is a bit much for my budget. I would be more inclined to keep this on hand if the price were lower.<br /><br />The bottom line-the flavor is good, the drink gives you energy at a high cost of calories and cash."

I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a ""candy dish"" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces."

With Plain Tart Yogurt - 5 Stars<br />4. With vanilla yogurt - 4 Stars<br /><br />Overall, this granola delivers good sized morsels of oats chocolate, and other goodies.  The granola itself is a bit sweet and dry, so it gets a little bit tiresome eating it plain.  That said, it's also a bit too sweet to really enjoy with other sweet things like vanilla yogurt.  Otherwise, I found the granola delicious.  Also, there was quite a bit of dust at the bottom of the bag, which was annoying but overall this product deserves 4 stars."

I have actually baked these with Parmesan cheese and some added garlic and onion for 15 min and had people rave about them being home made.

126414,B001PO7FDU,1.0,"I am disgusted that they are allowed to get away with tricking people. There is no actual truffle used in this product but they do everything they can to convince you that there is. The ingredients say organic sunflower oil and white truffle extract. Extract makes you think it was extracted from real truffles, doesn't it? Well, it wasn't. The extract is a chemical compound manufactured in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles.<br /><br />How about where it says in the label that ""White truffles originate in Alba, Italy and are considered to many to be the most prestigious truffles""...do you suppose that means white truffles from Italy have anything to do with this concoction? Well, they don't. They might as well have written, ""The sun is so and so many miles away from the earth."" They put that sentence in just to further trick you so you think that you are getting an expensive product with a grand tradition behind it when all you are getting is some cheap oil with some synthetic chemical added to it.<br /><br />They should be ashamed of themselves. Should they be allowed to sell you a synthetic chemical to eat? Maybe. Should they be allowed to market the product to convince customers that they are getting a product made with real truffles? No, they absolutely should not. We have food laws that are supposed to protect customers from this sort of trickery. The FDA has really dropped the ball on this.<br /><br />Update: They are getting even trickier. Their label has now been changed to read truffle extract instead of truffle aroma. I called the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (see section 201 for definitions) has never defined the term extract. I was specifically told this on the phone by an FDA representative. She said because the term extract has not been legally defined by this act, anything can be called an extract. Thus, La Tourangelle can legally get away with calling something a truffle extract even if truffles weren't used to make it."

I don't think that I would eat this in the morning for breakfast--I love chocolate, but that much early in the morning is too much for even me.<br />This is a good, simple, whole grain, fiber-rich (4g) snack.  Don't go overboard with it, though, because it does have plenty of calories (220 per 1/2 cup).  A 1/2 cup is just enough for a pick-me-up in the afternoon.

77745,B001LG940E,4.0,"This is better than any commercially available Black Cherry soda pop I've tried, which is saying a lot since I'm a big fan of the stuff.<br /><br />It's exactly what it claims to be: carbonated juice.<br /><br />It is lightly carbonated; about as fizzy as day-old champagne. Just enough to tickle the tongue and add a little crispness. Doesn't have the sharp bite and acidity of soda.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely juicy, not sugary like soda. But, it's not very complex. Think juice box. Despite claiming to be ""black cherry"", I'd say the primary flavor is actually grape. The company uses grape juice as a base for most of their products for sweetness. The cherry flavor is a very similar to a Jolly Rancher.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent alternative to soda. It's a bit on the pricey side at nearly a dollar for a 8.3 oz can. The only non-natural ingredient is ascorbic acid as a preservative.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'd say its worth buying. Its a refreshing drink that doesn't leave you feeling guilty or crashing from a sugar high later.<br /><br />My only criticism is, it needs more cherry flavor. I'd recommend a higher dose of cherry concentrate and substituting some pear juice for grape juice because pear has a more neutral flavor."

I much prefer homemade mashed, but like to have boxed on hand for emergencies. Did a web search and found Honest Earth All Natural Mashed potatoes on Amazon none the less!

17220,B006K02VJC,5.0,"These taste alot like a ""Mounds"" candy bar, Only fewer unecesary ingrediants, hence fewer calories. Mounds has 257 calories, 31 gr Carbs, 14g  SFat,25g sugar.

My disappointment was almost palpable and I actually had trouble finishing this drink.<br /><br />I'd have to say my primary impression was that I didn't really taste much watermelon or strawberry.  It's possible these two flavors just aren't meant to go together and cancel each other out.<br /><br />It's a little too sweet for me, although there is no added sugar.  I would have liked something with a bit more 'bite' to it.<br /><br />The primary juice ingredient is grape, followed by apple and acerola, then finally strawberry and watermelon (all from concentrate).  I think maybe a little less of one of the first three might have allowed more of the watermelon and/or strawberry come through."

I think I prefer Izze because it has a somewhat lighter flavor, but I can see why someone would like the slightly more robust flavor of Switch.<br /><br />The slogan of Switch is ""100% of what you want"" - pure juice - & ""0% of what you don't"" - preservatives, additives, etc.  It is worth noting that like all fruit juices this is fairly high in sugar - fructose instead of glucose, but still it is 33g of sugar per can.

The Switch is 100% juice so you can feel good about giving it to your family and it is carbonated so the kids will think they are getting soda, a win win situation!

This coffee is not as strong to me as this company's Fog Chaser brand, and is good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods. I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />Several folks in my office have also ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.

I lean towards French and Espresso Roast and Pike Place Market, all three made by a little company up in Seattle.  After reading the product description for Melitta Cafe Collection/Hazelnut Creme Brulee ground coffee , I had envisioned something like the sweetened Nestle's Tasters choice or something like that.  Ok, I knew this was ground coffee and not instant, but I am talking about the flavor aspect.<br /><br />I use a 2 cup drip coffee maker with a filter.  I followed the directions, adding 2 Teaspoons for each 6 ounces of coffee I wanted to make.  I went with 18 ounces worth which would be 6 teaspoons.  I like my coffee a bit strong so i added an extra teaspoon.  The coffee started to drip and my kitchen started smelling very nice which gave me high hopes for a very nice cup of coffee.<br /><br /> I drink my coffee with just a dash of milk and no sugar, so I did the same with the Creme Brulee.......  What I smelled and what I tasted didn't quite match up.  The taste? In a word , ""Artificial"" ........... While the coffee itself seemed fresh enough, albeit a bit weak in the caffeine area, the 'flavor' was not what I had hoped for...  While not a bad tasting coffee, my main complain would have to be a strange aftertaste that I just do NOT wish to taste first thing in the morning, or any other time for that matter.  Your mileage may vary, but for me I think I will just stick with my plain, unadulterated freshly ground beans from that little company up in Seattle."

In fact, she LOVES this stuff and will sit near the counter staring up at it.  My only issue with this product is that it really stinks....and I mean really stinks!!  I try to quickly open it, let my beagle take a few licks and then close it as quickly as possible.<br /><br />It works very similar to how a roll on deoderant would work so if you haven;t used it for a few days, it may take some manual intervention to get the top of the ball wet enough to turn on its own.

If you follow the directions I estimated it should smoke for about an hour or so. Boy were they overcooked. Since the directions also say not to open the bag it's hard to know how much time. If you have a very hot bbq, as I do, you may try cooking half the time, say 30 minutes. One thing for sure, the bag really works. I've never had a real smoker type bbq but the bags do a great job. ps, don't try your kitchen oven as the bags really give off alot of smoke and would smell up the house if you don't have a high output exhaust system.

When you bite into the dressed salad, there is a brief moment when you can taste the pumpkin flavor.<br /><br />The bottles are very tiny, and the plastic seal which you pull to open seems secure.  There was no leakage.<br /><br />The oil is a very dark greenish/reddish color.  I know it sounds like an implausible combination of colors, but that's what it looked like to me.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying the suggestion of drizzling it on ice cream.  Look forward to using this oil with other foods and in other ways.<br /><br />It's nice we can order these from amazon as the local Whole Foods only has the walnut oil and pecan oil from this brand, but does not carry the pumpkin seed oil.<br /><br />I might try this brand's walnut oil next, as it is significantly cheaper than the pumpkin seed oil."
81895,B005CUU25G,4.0,"I have three beagles and a lab.  To be honest, when I read about this product, I was dubious as to its ability to make them happy.  A lick?  That's it?<br />Well--I was right, and wrong.<br />When I first broke it out, the lab tried to eat it--he wasn't happy with the one lick.  The beagles saw him try to eat it, and then they were all about eating it, too.  But once they realized what it was all about, they LOVED it.  They were like crack addicts.  I put it on the dining room table, out of reach, and we kept catching them walking on their hind legs, noses over the table ledge, trying to get it.  They got so sneaky!  Climbing onto the chair?  Really?  When it was time for bed, when they usually get a cookie, they all ran to the table and gave me the distinct message--""WE want THAT!""<br />Last night I put the Lickety Stik on a tall shelf in the hallway of the house--and this morning, they ""knew"" exactly where it was, and wouldn't leave the hallway until I grabbed the thing and walked them outside.<br />So, we're calling it either crack for dogs or catnip for dogs haha..<br /><br />It's sort of like a roll-on deodorant style container.  The beef-gravy-like substance covers the ball and they simply lick it off.  Of course, as I said above, they will try to eat it at first, until they get the idea.  Although I'm convinced that should it get left within reach, they will eat the entire container.)<br /><br />It's a small container--about 5 inches long.  The picture made me think it would be much larger."

I was SO wrong and kick myself for the years I deprived myself of that sweet lemony goodness. Mmmm. I also tried key lime pie for the first time last year (crazy right? I'm so deprived lol ). Again I was hooked. So when I saw these key lime bars I thought I would be so in love with them. Always saw lemon bars never key lime bars. Awesomeness! I thought. Boy was I wrong. Made a box and they seemed ""off"". Just didn't taste right. Figured I did something wrong. So I made another box. Can't put my finger on it but something just isn't right. Not only that but as someone said while they were cooling in the fridge...'What is THAT? Looks like some weird science experiment"" And honestly it does. lol So sad they did not end up being as good as I had hoped. Now I have 10 boxes left.I guess I can try to doctor them up, maybe into a cheesecake? *shrugs* We'll see how that goes. Anyway I really wouldn't recommend this one. Maybe I got a batch batch?"

Like the Butterfingers do, Clark bars stick to your teeth.  But the Clark bars seem to be a little bit lighter and flakier then Butterfingers, so they're easier to get off of your teeth.  At least that's what I think.  Overall, if you like chocolate with a crunchy peanut center, I say Clarks are decent.  But my personal favorites are Kit Kats, 3 Musketeers, Milky Ways, and Reeses."
253993,B00416XWLS,2.0,These dog treats sounded so wonderful.  Didn't know they were made in China!  Wrote email to SmartBones and they assured me the product is safe. I will never trust animal products made in China.  So many products for dogs are made there. My dog hasn't gotten sick from the bones.  I suppose each consumer must make the choice for their own animals.  I looked for the Smartbones on several sites and didn't see China on the ads.  Seems like homemade might be better.  There is nothing like made in the USA.
149552,B000E8WIAS,3.0,I bought it as a substitute for powder Stevia hoping for better after-taste.<br />I am disappointed. The dropper design is faulty and I can't get drops in the coffee with out getting some on my fingers - an avoidable waste.<br />I also found that one needs to use more than a few drops to get the sweet taste.<br />The powder form is more economical if somebody makes half-packets of powder?

I think it adds a whole lot to the Black Cherry Switch experience.<br /><br />It isn't as sweet or fizzy as a regular soda, but I think that helps you taste it better. And it doesn't have that hint of oily sensation you get with high fructose corn syrup concoctions.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed my Switch. The size is just about right: 8.3 ounces was just enough for a treat."
168863,B001EQ5LOO,3.0,"This Tahini is ok.  I would've given it 3.5 stars if that was an option.  That said, nothing amazing about it.  Like some other reviewers, I had a cracked bottle that leaked the stuff all over.  Went on chat with Amazon support and got an overnight replacement.<br /><br />The stuff itself is ok, pretty liquidy, so it has to to be fresh--old stuff usually settles and appears dry on the bottom with oil on top.<br /><br />The taste was alright, not great, not bad, and not bitter.  But I wish they had mentioned that it was made from roasted sesame seeds.  I much prefer it raw as it is both healthier and tastier.  There is a brand they sell at a local Wholefoods, but that's $10 for a 1 pound jar.<br /><br />Overall, a decent product and great Amazon service, but I will not be buying this brand anymore unless they start producing the tahini made from raw sesame seeds."

236649,B008YA1NWC,2.0,I have been contemplating getting this for about a year but because it was a limted offer coffee it was way too expensive.  I almost broke because I heard all the great reviews.  Finally it became available for a normal price and it is one of the worst flavored coffees I've had.  My problem is that I like EXTREMLY bold and strong coffee. Also I am not normally into flavored coffees.  This stuff is weak and only has a hint of coconut.  I don't get it. Definitely will not buy again and will be sticking with my old faithful Midnight Magic!

167846,B004R8VPAK,3.0,"I purchased this product because I wanted to get a bulk price (5 pack) for camping this fall, and I was actually looking for Black Label, but could only find Tyson.  If you love Black Label, I can assure you will not love Tyson's fully-cooked bacon.  The appearance is similar, but the smoke flavor is quite different (obviously different wood) and it's much saltier.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is that the stiff plastic packaging opens very quickly (I was testing it today while making an omelet and needed to get it open in a hurry) as opposed to the Hormel product, which is in a cardboard box that is wasteful and doesn't really reclose, and its internal bag is very flimsy and doesn't protect the bacon well.  But unfortunately for me, flavor is even more important than packaging, and if I had not liked the packaging, I would have given this product a 1.  Black Label lovers beware."
81782,B005CUU25G,4.0,"Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.  Ten licks = 1 calorie.  I wasn't sure what to think about this product at first--great idea or somewhat odd?  My dogs made the decision for me:  they love it!  In fact, when I picked up the bottle to write this review, they both came running.<br /><br />I think Lickety Stik would be especially useful if your dog is on a diet, or when you're training and don't want to give too many high-calorie treats.  This is a winner at our house."

256507,B003JA5KBW,2.0,"I loved the concept - an energy drink made of healthy stuff useful not only for hydration but for energy. I had hopes of eliminating all soda and using this drink on hikes, workouts, etc. However it doesn't taste good, dilutes with very little water, and doesn't mix well. Did anyone at the company taste this stuff? Please go back to the drawing board. You had a great idea but this stuff doesn't work.<br /><br />Edit: the company has reached out to me and attempted to revisit this product. Amazing really in today's age of corporate and customer service indifference. I appreciate that kind of support and will try this product again because of the company's dedication to customer satisfaction and support. Thank you."

Has a caffeine kick and is smooth, but you need to remember it's chocolate truffle and then, perhaps, you get a hint of the taste.<br /><br />Not a bad brand, but I will not go out of my way to buy this.  You would be better off mixing chocolate syrup with your coffee.  Again, this is my personal opinion.  Others may find it more than okay.<br /><br />For my money, it's not worth it."

81849,B005CUU25G,4.0,"I have a three month old pug puppy who is incredibly food motivated.  Carrying around treats on a walk while I'm leash training him can be a hassle to fish out without spilling the rest or getting crumbs in my pockets.  We received a free sample of Lickety Stik at our puppy training class because of a pug's tendency to pack on the pounds and I was really surprised at how quickly the puppy took to it.  He will do tricks and readily follow on the leash to get a lick of this treat and becomes excited when he sees the bottle.<br /><br />The main drawback to this thing is that it stinks to high heaven and if I get a strong whiff of it the thing makes me gag.  The dog loves it, however so I am really considering buying more of this product in the future."

125125,B000NY8OLK,1.0,"A few weeks ago, I sent a complaint to Lindt via their web site and did receive a very nice email  response.  It mirrored pretty much what the web site says about the overwhelming positive response.<br /><br />Here's the funny part:  I was in a Lindt store last week and complained about the recipe change.  The sales person said that they've been receiving numerous complaints from previously-happy 70% customers.  And yes, the reason for the change in taste is that the bar is being manufactured in the US now, with a soya emulsifier and less cocoa butter.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my email to Lindt...  I hope they don't have the same PR disaster Coca-Cola had when they ""improved"" their recipe."
75647,B004MO6NI8,4.0,"I drank one of these in the morning before going surfing. I had a slight hangover from the night before and was a little groggy. This didn't give me the extreme energy boost you'd get from pre-workout powder like Muscletech Neurocore, Fruit Punch, .42 lbs (189 Grams) (which I have also reviewed), but it did help wake me up a bit.<br /><br />A nice thing about this stuff is it actually tastes pleasant. Sort of a fruity, pink lemonade-y kind of flavor. Almost too sweet, but that's better than the awful metal/syrup flavor of a lot of other energy sodas.<br /><br />I typically don't drink this kinds of things, preferring coffee when I need a boost in the morning, but this wasn't too bad. If you are an energy drink person and regularly pound Monster or Rockstar or Red Bull, etc. it might be worth giving this a shot. It's got the caffeine of about 1.5-2 cups of coffee and is a nice flavor alternative to some of the other energy drinks out there."

240173,B001VJ0B0I,2.0,"My 65 pound lab mix is not a picky eater. In fact she eats just about anything we give her. I was skeptical of this because Beneful is not known for quality dog food but figured the dog probably wouldn't care and she may even like it. Unfortunately not the case. My dog routinely leaves her bowl full and won't touch the food until she gets desperate towards the end of the night. We feed her twice a day but with this food, she will barely eat a bowl a day. She just doesn't like it.<br /><br />While the packaging is very nice with a sturdy plastic, re-zipable bag, the contents are underwhelming. The dog food is shaped in nice big chunks but the ingredients (as other reviewers have noted) are chicken by-product and corn filler. I prefer to give my dog a protein and she responds well to higher quality lamb mixes.<br /><br />I don't think we'll even finish this bag and instead go back to Trader Joe's lamb meal."

Over a year ago we used to feed our dog Beneful; after reading the label upon arrival I was reminded again why we stopped feeding him this overpriced garbage.<br /><br />Our cats are fed Science Diet Sensitive Stomach and our dog was/is eating a previously reviewed Vine product, Iams Sensitive Naturals Ocean Fish.  He is about to finish up that 25 pound bag.  After the bag finishes, I will have to walk into a pet store and methodically read the ingredients list before choosing another brand.  I would remain with the Iams Natural but I am concerned by the dry stools.  Then again, that is better than runny stools.<br /><br />Purina Beneful Original Dog Food's main ingredients are:<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Chicken By-Product meal<br />Corn Gluten Meal<br />Whole Wheat Flour<br />Preserved Animal Fat<br /><br />This is not good nor healthy!  This product is loaded with corn, corn and chicken by-product (read: eyeballs and beaks!).<br /><br />Did Furbie(Cock-a-poo)love it?  YES, but he also struggled with the kibble size and would always leave the uglier colored hard bits.  We would replenish the bowl and throw away the graveyard of green & yellow bits that remained.<br /><br />DO not recommend!  There are healthier alternatives priced right.

But the cookies were completely different than before - and not in a good way.  They are AWFUL.

I've never smelled anything like it. I now have to scoop at least twice a day, every day, or it's unbearable. Their, uh, output has increased significantly.

77634,B001LG940E,4.0,"The idea of a carbonated 100% fruit drink seems so simple I am surprised I have never encountered it before.  No extra sugar or nastiness added, just some carbonated bubbles and you are good to go.<br /><br />Drinking it is a little strange at first.  It is refreshing like a normal carbonated soda, but the flavor is all fruit.  I love black cherries, so I was thrilled by the flavor.  There is a slight aftertaste that you wouldn't get with normal pure fruit juice, and I can only assume that comes from the carbonation.<br /><br />The only problem with Switch is the small can size compared with the price.  Obviously, one expects to pay a bit more for more natural products, and pure juice is always more expensive than soda pop.  However, I knocked this one back pretty quickly, in just a few swallows, and on a hot day I would definitely want more.<br /><br />Where I think the Switch drinks really score is as a mixer for cocktails.  Try this with some vodka and ice, and it makes a really nice drink.  The pure fruit juice and carbonation make for a magical mixture."
249214,B004TPKAN4,2.0,"I've bought and enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past, and I like that their profits are donated to charity.  And I like cookies of all types and flavors.  So, I requested these cookies ... Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps ... to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.  After receiving these, I gathered the family test team to try them.<br /><br />First the good.  The cookies are a little over an inch in diameter, and perhaps an eight of an inch thick, a good size for a snack cookie. They have a strong ginger and molasses flavor, which is critical for a good gingersnap cookie.  And the cookies are made from organic ingredients.  That about sums up the good.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  The cookies were very hard and almost unchewable.  They were a dark brown on top and almost black on the bottom, as in they might have been really overbaked.  The molasses and ginger had a harsh flavor, with an unpleasant aftertaste that takes awhile to fade.  Again, it was almost as if they'd been baked to the point of being burnt.  My wife, who loves the occasional ginger snap, immediately commented that these were the worst gingersnap cookies she'd ever had. My youngest son, who's never met a treat he didn't like, refused a second cookie.  None of my crack test team liked them or wanted more.  So I've eaten the rest of the bag myself, partly to see if they grew on me, and partly to make sure that it just wasn't a few bad cookies.  Unfortunately, they neither grew on me or nor got any better the deeper into the bag I ate.<br /><br />I'm thinking maybe I got a bad bag of cookies ... I have a tough time believing a firm with the deserved good reputation as Newman's Own would consider what I received to be something they'd put their good name to.  But I have to rate what I've been provided, and I'm giving them a generous two stars."

I've tried Muscle Milk (not the light variety, since it has more carbs) and even the Costco brand protein drink. Save for the Costco stuff, I'm baffled why the recipes for these meal replacement drinks are so freaking sweet. Lookit, I love sucralose (Splenda), and I mean LOVE. I'll add anywhere from 5 to 22 packets of Splenda to my coffee (I hate the taste of coffee). I make sure to keep a giant Costco-size bag of Splenda always in stock at home, and many of my jacket pockets have packets of Splenda stuffed in them in case I go somewhere that doesn't offer it as sweetener. I even have a copy of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W91SZA"">The SPLENDA World of Sweetness: Recipes for Homemade Desserts and Delicious Drinks</a> (gifted because: see above). So yeah, me and Splenda are forever bonded. Given all that, you'd think the sweetness of Labrada's Lean Body RTD Bananas and Cream would be to me what ice is to water, buuuuut no. The sweetness is so overpowering and cloying that I have to water the drink down before consuming it. The bonus of doing of that, though, means my 12 bottles turn into 24, essentially. If I buy the stuff again, it'll be because I didn't have time to go to Costco to get their meal replacement drink."

249486,B001LGGH54,2.0,"I like apple juice, but when I drink a beverage that is supposed to taste like watermelons and strawberries, I want to taste watermelon and strawberries!  The overriding flavor in this drink is apple juice.  If I concentrated hard enough, I could (almost) detect a faint taste of watermelon, but not enough to convince me to purchase this soft drink again.<br /><br />If you like apple juice more than watermelons or strawberries, this soft drink would be perfect for you.  It's got plenty of carbonation, and it's healthy, with no added sugar or artificial sweeteners (which is why I gave it two stars).  Even without the sugar, it's plenty sweet (but not too much).  If you want a flavor other than apple, try the tangerine.  Of the three flavors I've tried, tangerine is the only one to actually taste like it's should."
82750,B005ATIDNC,4.0,"I sincerely hope this review doesn't confuse the potential buyer, but I found it important enough to write this.<br /><br />If you have had real Tulsi tea, in the sense, if you had a Tulsi plant in your home, and you have made and drunk plenty of tea after crushing and boiling those fresh tulsi leaves in your tea, then this product will likely not be to your liking. It is way too strong/fragrant. So much so that it barely smells like Tulsi (which has a very mild, consistent smell).<br /><br />What I'd like to stress to you at this point is that ""way too strong"" may exactly be what you love; but I didn't. I'll have to go back to the more expensive Teatulia tea bags for ""my"" preferred taste.<br /><br />I'll also add that the bag I received says USDA certified organic. Don't think it said that here on the Amazon description.<br /><br />Hope you find your Tulsi tea!!!!"

This stuff tasted terrible!!! I really thought it was bad, or tainted! So I had 3 others taste it, and with the same results! Immediately it went into the garbage! Maybe their other items taste ok, but the Cashew Butter, was just gross tasting! I recently went to Aruba and at a grocery store there purchased a jar of cashew butter, and it was fantastic!! Soooo I thought hmmm, why not buy some more on line... WHAT A MISTAKE! I should have just burned the 20.00!! Stay away from the cashew butter from this seller!!! YUCK!! No, DOUBLE YUCK!!"
158657,B001189I3A,3.0,Hello guys...<br />I recently bought this item. I have a deep dark circles on my face  which are like really dark. I am most likely to buy natural and organic products. So I ran into this item while googling. After reading all the reviews I have decided to buy it. I am using this item since a month. I can't really see any change instead it leaves my eyes reddish in color. May be it doesn't suits for me. Even if it works for anyone else. But it's not worth the given price

134538,B003E728CE,1.0,"I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these.  However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours).  It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this).  The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see).  Our other dog (full adult) did fine, however.  Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google ""pill pockets diarrhea"", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds."
167343,B007PE7ANY,3.0,"The free sample of the Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt Bar was just ok.  I was hoping for more of a contrast between the sweet chocolate and the salty nut taste, but I got more of a nutty and less chocolate taste.  Plus, it was very hard to chew - kind of like the hard, brittle consistency of peanut-brittle, which made me worry about chipping a tooth."
82356,B0060JMVM0,4.0,"the quality of oil is great. I give it four stars because of the tin design. It is difficult to pour out the oil without it dripping leftovers on top.<br /><br />For those who haven't had real evoo, it might taste bitter at first- as a fresh oil will. I was initially surprised by the bitterness, but over time have appreciated it because it cuts down on the unctousness; works great with the acidity in vinegars for dressings or dipping bread. EVOO is very healthy and should be used raw if possible, only apply light heat to it. this isn't an oil for frying."

254267,B002UQ6R0O,2.0,"I am a tea snob, and I knew the price was way way too good to be true. I was right. The tea is very pale, like it is old or was exposed to light. It is mostly powder and stems, no popped kernels, barely any toasted rice taste, and definitely not the delicate taste that this tea is supposed to have. I literally brewed it for maybe a minute and it was very dark green and just tasted like cheap green tea, not Gen Mai Cha. It is very inexpensive, so I guess you get what you pay for. I have had a metallic taste in my mouth for the past 3 hours since I drank half a cup of it."

I cut this food out and he's stopped getting sick. Thank goodness it didn't get as bad as some other reviewer's experiences; I'm glad I stopped giving him this one before it did.<br /><br />TL;DR: Grain free seems like a good idea, but this food is a terrible choice.

Poured on the mix and baked as directed on the package.Guests loved it.  Second, I added ground nuts and almond flavoring to the mix, poured it into a bundt pan, and after baking poured a lemon glaze on top.  Delicious.<br /><br />Wish this mix could be healthier.

17331,B000EVIDUY,5.0,"These are soooooooo delicious!  I just baked these this evening and they were a huge hit.  We all agreed that they taste just as good if not better than some of the best wheat flour brownie mixes out there.  They were moist and very rich with a crunchy (but not hard, just right) top. I cut back a little on the margarine.  It calls for 7 tablespoons of butter but instead I used 4 tablespoons of Earth Balance with 3 tablespoons of applesauce.  Also, I baked them in cupcake liners because I like to freeze them and take them out as needed.  It tasted perfect this way but I can't comment on how this modification compares to the original recipe since I haven't tried it the other way.  I will be sure to stock my pantry with this mix!"

80930,B0029JW9JU,4.0,"This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie."
148623,B001OCBT3U,3.0,"I actually prefer the Triple Nut version of this bar better despite the fact that I really like peanuts.  I think it is just a little bit too much like a candy bar for me to actually want to eat it too often and when I had one in my pocket for a few hours it got really messy because the peanut butter melted and got all over the inside of the wrapper and made the bar sticky and not that attractive looking, in fact it was a hot day when these were delivered so they were already pretty messed up before I even got them.  They do taste pretty good, so if you like things sweet, like peanuts and peanut butter and don't mind that they can get kinda messy, you would like this bar."

132654,B002EM2JCY,1.0,I was very happy to find that this water was available for order. I ordered a dozen and ordered 3 dozen more. My first box was just delievered a half hour ago and the seals were broken on several bottles. Th order was also missing 2 bottles! I suspect warehousing was thirsty??? I even signed up for a monthly save subscriptons to have them mailed to me every month going forward. I  am so disappointed right now!! The other three dozen were shippe to me today but the rep was great in having contacted UPS to return the order to them. He candelled the subscription and told me to expect a refund 2-3 days after the orders are returned to the warehouse.
126683,B003IHO8LY,1.0,Product did not work as advertised.  Don't waste your money.  Plus drinking a 14.5 oz of bottle to try to get to sleep is not good.

16601,B001LGGH40,5.0,"Normally, anything with strawberry and kiwi flavor tends to actually be mainly grape juice and taste like over ripe fruit.  Not this one... it's absolutely delicious, not overly sweet, and actually tastes like the fruit pictured on the can.  I like that it is naturally sweetened, using no corn syrup.  It's not too sweet either.  Just tastes like fizzy fresh fruit.  Highly recommended."
155450,B000GAT6NG,3.0,This product is supposed to be very good for you. But you need to make sure that you like coconut flavor...because it will add a little coconut flavor to your food. It is a little annoying that you have to melt the oil everytime you want to use it. But if you want the health benefits it is worth it. I haven't used it long enough to recognize any changes or benefits in my health.

158441,B0008DIEBG,3.0,"I recently purchased this product (not here but at walmart where it is $6 a box not $10) for a cake I was making for a friend.  I usually do cakes in butter cream and fondant but she wanted whipped icing.  Anyway,  I did a test batch a week before and it was really good.  The icing came out fluffy and stiff enough for icing and piping. It held up really well in the fridge for several days.  However the day of the cake it was a very hot day and not having air conditioning, my kitchen was very warm.  The icing completely collapsed despite several tries with several batches, freezing the bowl and mixer whisk, ice applied to the bowl, and extended whipping,  I could not get it to stiffen.  It was a soft, runny mess and did not make for nice icing.  I was unable to pipe with it at all. So if you purchase this just keep that in mind.  I still prefer buttercream but the taste is creamy and less sweet that buttercream if that is what you prefer."
131143,B001F3G2TO,1.0,"If you like dried manogos, don't buy these because they are not.  they may have started out as mangos but by the time they were mashed, sugared, colored, and shaped they resembled mangos and tasted like sawdust with a lot of sugar and some flavor that vaguely resembled mangos.  After my experience with this company, I will never do business with them again."

126599,B001EUG65I,1.0,"We bought the multi-pack that comes with the standard non-edible nylabones. After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this ""edible"" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically ""edible"", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.<br /><br />Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.<br /><br />My advice, steer clear of these ""healthy"" edible Nylabones."

A local garden outlet would be a better source for this product."
123708,B001SAZRX6,1.0,I love Brachs butterscotch & they are so hard to find so when I found them in my local albertsons I was ecstatic. Well that was short lived because the original Brachs butterscotch that has the yellow wrapper with blue writing no longer exists!! The new version sucks!! The taste is different as well as the texture and I hate them! Ill never understand why companies feel the need to change products that are not broken. I'm very upset bc the original was amazing and anyone who loved them will notice the horrible change in the new version. Bad move Brachs!!
81741,B005CUU25G,4.0,"I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!"
76936,B001OCKIP0,4.0,"On first bite, I found this granola to lack much sweetness.  Then again, I am comparing it to those sugary cereals that people who are looking into this product are probably trying to avoid.  Adding some milk, I found that the cereal was very nicely balanced and has a very healthy taste.  That means that I felt good after eating it and not weighed down.  As for the technical nutritional facts, the ingredients and stats are listed here (a nice thing about Amazon).  The absence of high fructose corn syrup and the basic natural ingredients are quite reassuring, but, as with all granolas I've seen, portion control will be needed to keep the calorie count down (220 per half cup).  I found the texture quite good for cereal, crumbly bits and all, which is how I eat it.  It may be a bit messy for casual consumption by hand.<br /><br />Overall, this is really basic.  It would be quite inexpensive and easy to make this yourself.  That is not a bad thing, though.  It means that when convenience is at a premium, this product carries the benefits and comforts of something homemade.  If the price doesn't scare you, I would heartily recommend it."
136439,B006Q820X0,1.0,Very disappointed in the quality of the k cups. Had various k cups spill grounds into my mug. Have also burnt myself on thses cups due to the water not running through fully. Would not recommend.

Next time I'm going for the lifesaver jelly beans, maybe I'll have better luck!"

252323,B000GZW5AC,2.0,"I used to like these chips when they had 2 grams of fat, but at some point in the past year or two they have changed to 3 grams of fat. This Amazon listing still claims 2, but if you check them out at whole foods, all the Guiltless chips have at least 3 grams. Some people may say that this increase is not significant, but you can a cheap bag of fried corn chips with only 4 grams of fat (can't think of the brand, but they come in a large paper bag), so 1 gram either makes a difference to you or is doesn't and you don't need baked chips.<br />If you want low fat chips, you can get baked blue corn chips at Trader Joe's with 2 grams of fat or at Henry's Farmers Market with only 1 gram of fat. Lay's also used to make corn chips with 1 gram of fat and absolutely no oil added, but they stopped selling those a couple of years back (and Lay's current lowest fat corn chips is 3 grams).<br />These Guiltless chips do taste good, but I certainly don't taste any difference from the new version than the old ones with 2/3rds that fat content."

245606,B004OAZ36I,2.0,"I bought the 34 count. Maybe I caought the packaging department on an off day. I recieved 10 flavors in my package, which would be fine, but 4 of the flavors only had one sample. Several of the flavors were very common flavors and not that exciting. A majority of the box I received was Donut shop chocolate glazed (5), Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream (6), and of course Kahlua (8)... that is 19/34, so almost 2/3 of the package was 3 flavors.<br /><br />This sampler was not what I was hoping for and seemed to be a compilation of the flavors you see on the discount shelves at the store all the time. I could have bought a box of 18 Kahlua at big lots for $7. I would think that any sampler should limit themselves to know more that 4 of any given flavors."
253447,B004JRMG98,2.0,"As someone who doesn't care for ranch, I should have known better! It's kinda ranch-y, kinda sour-cream-y, kinda mayo-y - all flavors I detest. The jalapeno flavor isn't that strong and I kinda wish it was. This is not a sauce I would put on tacos, but maybe chips or even a salad.<br /><br />I actually prefer Taco Bell's non-creamy sauces, which is what I'll stick with from here out! I love hot and spicy sauces, but this one, um, no."

132715,B000VZ8DJ4,1.0,I enjoy this gum but this is one of those purchases where you get three flavors and one is clearly the favorite and you don't want to chew the others.
